N2  - Background: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) incidence in hospitalized children has increased over the past decade and disease has been reported in the community. Therefore, population surveillance that includes nonhospitalized cases is important to accurately estimate the burden of CDI in children. We describe the epidemiology of CDI in the pediatric population of Monroe County, New York. Method(s): Active, laboratory, and population-based surveillance for CDI has been ongoing in Monroe County through the Emerging Infections Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2010. Infants less than 12 months of age are excluded. Result(s): In 2010, the incidence of CDI in the pediatric population was 33.8 per 100 000 population, which increased to 45.8 in 2011and remained stable in 2012. Seventy-one percent of the CDI cases were community-associated, 60% had an underlying medical condition, and 71% received antibiotics before their illness. The North American pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type 1 (NAP1) epidemic strain was identified in 27% of cultured stool specimens. Conclusion(s): Clostridium difficile infection has emerged as a disease affecting children in both the community and hospital settings, with a higher proportion of community illness in our population. The majority of children with CDI had chronic underlying conditions and prior antibiotic exposure. To prevent CDI in this population, the judicious use of antibiotics, especially in the outpatient setting, may be the best strategy. Further population-based studies are warranted to determine preventable risk factors for CDI in the pediatric population. © The Author 2014.

N2  - With 1.4 million deaths and 8.7 million new cases in 2011, tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health care problem and together with HIV and Malaria represents one of the three infectious diseases world-wide. Control of the global TB epidemic has been impaired by the lack of an effective vaccine, by the emergence of drug-resistant forms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and by the lack of sensitive and rapid diagnostics. It is estimated, by epidemiological reports, that one third of the world's population is latently infected with Mtb, but the majority of infected individuals develop long-lived protective immunity, which controls and contains Mtb in a T cell-dependent manner. Development of TB disease results from interactions among the environment, the host, and the pathogen, and known risk factors include HIV co-infection, immunodeficiency, diabetes mellitus, overcrowding, malnutrition, and general poverty; therefore, an effective T cell response determines whether the infection resolves or develops into clinically evident disease. Consequently, there is great interest in determining which T cells subsets mediate anti-mycobacterial immunity, delineating their effector functions. On the other hand, many aspects remain unsolved in understanding why some individuals are protected from Mtb infection while others go on to develop disease. Several studies have demonstrated that CD4+ T cells are involved in protection against Mtb, as supported by the evidence that CD4+ T cell depletion is responsible for Mtb reactivation in HIV-infected individuals. There are many subsets of CD4+ T cells, such as T-helper 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17, and regulatory T cells (Tregs), and all these subsets co-operate or interfere with each other to control infection; the dominant subset may differ between active and latent Mtb infection cases. Mtb-specific-CD4+ Th1 cell response is considered to have a protective role for the ability to produce cytokines such as IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha that contribute to the recruitment and activation of innate immune cells, like monocytes and granulocytes. Thus, while other antigen (Ag)-specific T cells such as CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, gammadelta T cells, and CD1-restricted T cells can also produce IFN-gamma during Mtb infection, they cannot compensate for the lack of CD4+ T cells. The detection of Ag-specific cytokine production by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and the use of flow cytometry techniques are a common routine that supports the studies aimed at focusing the role of the immune system in infectious diseases. Flow cytometry permits to evaluate simultaneously the presence of different cytokines that can delineate different subsets of cells as having "multifunctional/polyfunctional" profile. It has been proposed that polyfunctional T cells, are associated with protective immunity toward Mtb, in particular it has been highlighted that the number of Mtb-specific T cells producing a combination of IFN-gamma, IL-2, and/or TNF-alpha may be correlated with the mycobacterial load, while other studies have associated the presence of this particular functional profile as marker of TB disease activity. Although the role of CD8 T cells in TB is less clear than CD4 T cells, they are generally considered to contribute to optimal immunity and protection. CD8 T cells possess a number of anti-microbial effector mechanisms that are less prominent or absent in CD4 Th1 and Th17 T cells. The interest in studying CD8 T cells that are either MHC-class Ia or MHC-class Ib-restricted, has gained more attention. These studies include the role of HLA-E-restricted cells, lung mucosal-associated invariant T-cells (MAIT), and CD1-restricted cells. Nevertheless, the knowledge about the role of CD8+ T cells in Mtb infection is relatively new and recent studies have delineated that CD8 T cells, which display a functional profile termed "multifunctional," can be a better marker of protection in TB than CD4+ T cells. Their effector mechanisms could contribute to control Mtb infection, as upon activation, CD8 T cells release cytokines or cytotoxic molecules, which cause apoptosis of target cells. Taken together, the balance of the immune response in the control of infection and possibly bacterial eradication is important in understanding whether the host immune response will be appropriate in contrasting the infection or not, and, consequently, the inability of the immune response, will determine the dissemination and the transmission of bacilli to new subjects. In conclusion, the recent highlights on the role of different functional signatures of T cell subsets in the immune response toward Mtb infection will be discerned in this review, in order to summarize what is known about the immune response in human TB. In particular, we will discuss the role of CD4 and CD8 T cells in contrasting the advance of the intracellular pathogen in already infected people or the progression to active disease in subjects with latent infection. All the information will be aimed at increasing the knowledge of this complex disease in order to improve diagnosis, prognosis, drug treatment, and vaccination. © 2014 Prezzemolo, Guggino, La Manna, Di Liberto, Dieli and Caccamo.

N2  - Background: In Switzerland, incidence of sexual transmitted infections (STI) is increasing in HIV positive individuals, particularly including an epidemic for sexually acquired acute HCV-infection in MSM. Patients with a primary HIV-infection (PHI) represent a sexual highly active population and may contribute to this epidemic, possibly due to changed sexual risk practices influenced by the "Swiss statement" in 2008, postulating that individuals on effective antiretroviral therapy are non-infectious. Methodology: Between January 2002 and April 2013 we prospectively enrolled 293 individuals with a well defined PHI in the Zurich Primary HIV Infection Study and in the Swiss HIV cohort study (SHCS). At study-begin, individuals were actively screened for hepatitis C and B, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and herpes genitalis. During the study-period, STI-screening was performed based on clinical symptoms, reported sexual risk practices and by yearly serological syphilis and HCV testing. STI were determined by a detailed medical chart review including history, symptoms of STI and screening tests. Condom use is reported in the SHCS database 6 monthly. The impact of calendar year and condom use on HCV/syphilis incidence was assessed with Coxproportional- hazard models. Result(s): We analysed 293 individuals (271 males). Transmission mode included MSM (79%), heterosexual (20 %) and IVDA (1 %). Of all, 49 (17%) individuals had a concomitant STI at presentation. During follow-up period, syphilis was the most prevalent STI with 93 cases, followed by gonorrhoea: 40, chlamydia: 38; acute HCV-infection: 16; herpes genitalis: 8, acute hepatitis B: 2. Incidence rates of syphilis and acute HCV-infections were significantly increasing over the study-period, most pronounced in the latter (figure 1, panel A). For syphilis, there was a significant linkage between increasing incidence and imperfect condom use (p<0.001), whereas for acute HCV-infection such correlation was also found, but only as a trend (p=0.18) (figure 1, panel B). Conclusion(s): Increasing incidence rates of STI's represent a surrogate for changed sexual risk behavior in patients with PHI, may be fostered by the "Swiss statement" that has been endorsed however only for patients in stable partnerships. The ongoing epidemic of acute HCV-infections affecting MSM can not solely be explained by unprotected sex and remains unclear. Risk-group targeted prevention programs, mainly propagation of condom use, are urgently needed. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Background: The burden of disease in developing countries is shifting from infectious to noncommunicable diseases with devastating consequences to public health. As in most of the developing countries Nepal is currently experiencing a rapid growth in cardiovascular disease (CVD) but there is little community-based data available to measure its impact and track trends. The Dhulikhel Heart Study (DHS), based out of Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University, was designed to address this need by providing comprehensive data using standardized protocols to evaluate CVD prevalence, incidence, and risk factors. Structure/Method/Design: The DHS is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study targeting all adults age >=18 years and residing in the town of Dhulikhel, in central Nepal, for a baseline examination and planned 20-year follow-up. The home visit includes collection of informed consent, demographic and socio-economic characteristics, medical history, health behaviours, physical and cognitive function, anthropometry, and blood pressure measurement. A fasting blood sample will be collected for blood glucose, HbA1c, and lipid profile. Participants will be invited to Dhulikhel Hospital to undergo electrocardiography, echocardiography, carotid doppler and adipose tissue measurement. Outcome measures will focus on mortality and CVDrelated morbidities. Cause of death will be ascertained using hospital records and verbal autopsy while CVD events will be identified from medical records and measured during regular surveillance. Logistic and linear regression along with mixed models and survival analysis will be used to estimate factors related to risk of specific outcomes. Collaborative writing groups will be convened to develop manuscripts and publish results. Results (Scientific Abstract)/Collaborative Partners (Programmatic Abstract): The baseline examination is currently underway with an expected sample of 9000 adults to be completed by summer 2014 with repeat visits to occur every 2 years. Summary/Conclusion: Results of the DHS will provide important data on the epidemiology of hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease and stroke in Nepal to help develop evidence-based programs for their prevention and treatment. Methods may be used as a model for other low-income countries that are developing plans to address this emerging epidemic.

N2  - Introduction: Hepatitis C constitutes a major public health burden. In Portugal, the prevalence is estimated at 1-1.5% [1]. Of these, only 30% are presumed to be diagnosed, which reveals that most infections go unknown. The objective of this study is to identify the age-range distribution at HCV diagnosis and to identify the high-prevalence birth groups that could be targeted for screening, as a strategy to increase diagnosis and identify patients who would benefit most from treatment. Method(s): Retrospective observational study of a cohort of chronic HCV-infected and HIV co-infected patients followed at an Infectious Diseases Center, diagnosed between 1979 and 2014 (Figure 1). Hepatic fibrosis evaluation was performed by real time elastography using METAVIR score. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, virological and therapeutic data was retrieved from clinical registries. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2010. Chi2, Student T were used for a significant p value of B0.05. Result(s): Our study assessed a cohort of 665 patients: 442 (66.5%) HCV/HIV co-infected and 223 (33.5%) HCV monoinfected. There was a male predominance in both groups (74.9% vs 70.9%). The mean age was 47 HCV/HIV vs 49 years; Portuguese origin in 80% vs 83% and African in 14% vs 12%. The most frequently assumed transmission route was by intravenous drug use (IVDU) (81% vs 72%), followed by sexual contact (18% vs 20%). Mean age at diagnosis was 32 vs 40 years. Mean time since HCVdiagnosiswas 14, 6 vs 9, 6 years. Fibrosis stage evaluation by real time elastography was available for 133 (30%) and 99 (44.4%) patients (HCV/HIV vs HCV): 16% vs 13% F1; 32% vs 33% F2; 31% vs 35% F3; 21% vs 18% F4. The peak prevalence occurred between the birth intervals of 1960-1969 and 1970-1979 for both groups, corresponding to 81% vs 66,8% (p=0.003) (Figure 1). About three quarters of all patients (76%) were born between the year of 1960 and 1979, with a prevalence of 70% of IVDU. (Figure presented) Conclusion(s): In our cohort we identify a high risk population for chronically HCV infection, which comprises people born between 1960 and 1979, findings common to those with mono or HIV co-infection. This finding is concordant with the epidemic of IVDU in Portugal around 1980-1990. These patients should be screened for diagnosis in order to be treated and to prevent further disease progression.

N2  - Poliomyelitis is a highly infectious viral disease, affecting mainly children <5 years of age. Globally, poliomyelitis cases have decreased by 99% since 1988, but outbreaks continue to occur. In May, 2013 an outbreak of wild type poliovirus with 14 cases was reported in Kenya, among them 13 cases were from Dadaab refugee camps and host communities. An immunization campaign providing inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) and oral polio vaccine (OPV) was launched. We conducted a post-campaign coverage survey to assess the impact and guide future use of IPV. We selected 30 blocks in each of the five refugee camp, and 30 villages in the host communities, by probability proportional to size with replacement. We visited nine households in each block and five households in each village, plus a convenience sample of nomad settlements. Within each household we collected data on all children <5 years on IPV and/or OPV; the youngest child age 6 to 59 months was selected for questions about OPV received through routine immunization. Vaccine coverage and 95% confidence intervals were calculated accounting for clustering. We enrolled 1,084 households, including 2,173 children from refugee camps and host communities and 118 from nomad households. Coverage of OPV plus IPV in the December campaign was 92.8 %(90.2%-94.8%) in refugee camps and 95.8%(93.5%-97.3%) in host communities; OPV coverage in the November campaign was 97.2% (95.4%-98.3%) in refugee camps and 97.3%(95.0%-98.5%) in host communities. Among the 118 children <5 years of age from nomadic households, 40(34%) received IPV plus OPV in December, and 37(31%) had received OPV in November. Among caregivers, 1009(99%) reported being aware of the campaign; 766(76%) knew from megaphone announcements, 475(47%) from social mobilizer, 435(43%) from healthcare worker, and 367(36%) heard from the radio. Among 107 children >6 weeks old who missed IPV, 49(46%) caregivers cited not knowing the location of the vaccination. IPV was successfully delivered with high community acceptance both in refugee camps and host communities. Strategies are needed to improve coverage in nomadic populations.

N2  - Ecuador is facing new challenges related to climate change impacts in the human health sector, especially for emerging infectious diseases, such as dengue fever. Although the public health sector is investing substantially in measures of surveillance and mosquito control, the effects of climate variability and change are not considered in the current strategies for reducing dengue virus transmission. Effective planning for adaptation measures in the public health sector would require the following: a) a better understanding of climate and environmental interactions with the vector and disease transmission in which a monitoring and surveillance climate-disease program is fundamental b) an evaluation of the effectiveness of current policies and measures in reducing the vector disease including 'what if' analysis in projected scenarios, and finally c) building scientific capacity in research institutions and looking for a permanent dialog with stakeholders and decision makers to discuss the adaptation measures on the climate change impacts on infectious diseases. With this perspective, a consortium of national and international institutions and local public health organizations is developing an interdisciplinary research program on dengue transmission in the city of Machala, Ecuador. This 3-year study will develop predictive models by linking climate factors with local neighborhood social and environmental conditions to predict when and where dengue outbreaks will occur in Machala, Ecuador. This study aims to link multi-scale climate phenomena to neighborhood-level dengue risk, fundamentally changing how we think about climate-disease dynamics. At the same time, an iterative process of monitoring and evaluation of adaptation measures linked to decision making aids and tools is proposed for developing climate change policy in the public health sector.

N2  - Chikungunya virus is an emerging infectious disease in Southeast Asia. The first chikungunya outbreak in Bangladesh was reported in 2008 in Chapai Nawabganj, a district in northwest Bangladesh bordering India. Two more outbreaks occurred in 2011 in the same district. It is unclear whether these outbreaks are markers of large-scale transmission throughout the district or isolated events. We conducted a serosurvey in Chapai Nawabganj to better understand chikungunya dispersal and to determine factors associated with exposure. Between March - May 2013, we randomly selected 40 communities and selected all household members to participate in the study until we enrolled 30-50 individuals per community. We collected a blood sample and socio-demographic characteristics and typical travel behavior from all participants. We used IgG ELISAs (NovaLisaTM, Dietzenbach, Germany) to identify past chikungunya infection. We used a multivariate logistic regression model with a random intercept for each community to identify risk factors. Overall 6.7% (87/1290) of individuals had evidence of chikungunya infection. Half of the communities, located in the north of the district, had no seropositive cases at all. Communities in the south, nearby previous outbreak sites, had up to 56% seropositivity. Individuals < 20 years were 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-4.2) times more likely to be seropositive than older individuals. Having another seropositive individual in the same household increased the risk of previous infection 1.4 (95% CI, 1.2 - 2.0) times and each additional seropositive individual within the community (but outside the home) increased the risk of past exposure 1.3 (95% CI, 1.2 - 1.3) times. Gender and travel history were not associated with past exposure. Very high proportions of people infected in some communities and no infections in communities in a small geographic area suggests that transmission was very intense in outbreak communities, but the virus failed to transmit beyond outbreak communities. Research into spatial difference in vector ecology may help us understand heterogeneities in outbreak risk across this area.

N2  - Arbovirus transmission is dependent on the transmission efficiency between infectious and susceptible hosts. Heterogeneity of virus acquisition from a viremic human to a susceptible mosquito is often assumed to be nearly perfect and almost always uniform across the infectious period. Chikungunya transmission models often do not account for the variation in infectiousness of a single individual, and subsequent infection of naive mosquitoes. Understanding the contribution of human infectious heterogeneity is especially important in the context of introduction events where an infected individual carries the virus into a population(s) of competent vectors. We construct a stochastic, compartmental model to describe the heterogeneity of human viremia and calculate the probability of a successful introduction, taking into account the viremia level (and thus acquisition potential) of the index case on, and after, the day of introduction into a susceptible population. We inform our model based on the experience of dengue emergence in South Florida, 2009-2013. We further account for viral genotype and predominant vector (Ae. aegypti versus Ae. albopictus) by altering the transmission efficiency rate between the human and specific mosquito populations by exploring 1) differential vector competence between genotypes of chikungunya and 2) differential contact rates within and between the two mosquito populations. We find that the infectivity of the index case as well as the parameters affecting transmission efficiency affected the probability of emergence, but that the effects among these parameters were not equal. To predict the likelihood and magnitude of a potential chikungunya outbreak in the United States, it is critical to understand the interplay between individual human heterogeneity of infectiousness and the transmission efficiency of the virus and vector populations.

N2  - Asia is a huge and populated continent and is aging rapidly, which poses various health care challenges to the world. Due to the multimorbidity and immunosenescence, infectious diseases and/or the reaction of certain infectious diseases have gained extensive attentions nowadays. Moreover, various emerging respiratory infections were discovered in Asia. In recent years, adult vaccinations has become more and more popular in Asian countries. From influenza vaccines, pneumococcal vaccines, human papillomavirus vaccines to herpes zoster vaccine, adult vaccination may gradually change the epidemiology of diseases in Asia as well as the disease burden. This symposium will focus on the current development of adult vaccination in Asian countries and to explore the clinical benefits of these vaccinations and the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in frail older people. Four speakers from Taiwan, Japan and South Korea will report the conditions of adult vaccination in their own countries as below. Adult vaccination: the trend of development in Taiwan (L.K. Chen): Taiwan has become an aging country in 1993 and will become an aged country by 2017. Moreover, the percentage of people aged 65 years and older is estimated to reach 20% by 2025, which poses various health care challenges to the country. Amongst, adult vaccination is an issue of great importance. Traditionally, vaccination is considered a pediatric issue in Taiwan before the outbreak of SARS. After SARS, the influenza vaccination has got gradual acceptance by the public. Nevertheless, over the past 10 years, the vaccination rate for the elderly population is still considered low that approximately 50-60% of people aged 65 years and older received influenza vaccination every year. After influenza vaccine, the pneumococcal vaccine became more visible to the public but it was not a government funded vaccination program until a big charity foundation started to freely provide polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccination for people aged 75 years and older. Nowadyas, more and more adult vaccines have been introduced to Taiwan, including HPV and herpes zoster vaccine. However, the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practice in Taiwan is mainly composed of pediatricians that deserves further consideration to add more geriatricians in the future. Use of pneumococcal vaccines in Korea (C.W. Won): In the past, the rate of pneumococcal vaccination for the elderly in South Korea was very low as it had not been included in tha national vaccination program. It's rate was 3.4% in 2007 and 15.4% in 2012. However, in February 2013, pneumococcal vaccination for the elderly (65+ years) was included in national vaccination program by law, and charge-free pneumococcal vaccinations for elderly through public health centers have been implemented since May of 2013. The charge free vaccine used in the national program is 23-Valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. The detailed statement of vaccination is to be registered in Immunization registry information system managed by Korean Center for Disease Control. The national pneumococcal vaccine program is aimed at 60% of vaccination rate for the elderly by 2015. In 2013, the first year of the program, about 40% (2,466,019 persons) of the Korean elderly got the vaccine through the program. People aged 75 and over comprise 47.2% of the vaccinated. Epidemiology and disease burden of herpes zoster in Japan (T. Kojima): Introduction: The incidence of herpes zoster increase with age in association with a gradual decline of cell-mediated immunity. The zoster vaccine proved to reduce morbidity from herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia among older adults remarkably. Despite the enormous increase in the elderly population in Japan, development of vaccine program for elderly are still limited in the country and there is no immunization program for zosters. In this session, the disease burden of herpes zoster in Japan and a potential vaccine to be applied for preventing herpes zoster will be introduced. Method(s): The herpes zoster burden of disease in Japan was investigated by domestic literature review. The live varicella vaccine (Oka Strain) that had been developed in Japan has been available for preventing varicella, although there are some reports that showed efficacy for herpes zoster prevention. These reports were also reviewed. Result(s): From the epidemiological studies, incidence of varicella zoster was frequent among older adult, especially in those in their 70s. Also from the reports, the live varicella vaccine had been proved to activate virus-specific cell-mediated immunity in Japanese elderly, which possibly leads to zoster prevention. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, vaccine for herpes zoster is not yet available in Japan. The reports show that the live herpes zoster vaccine available for the varicella prevention effectively enhanced specific immunity to varicella zoster virus in older people, and could be used for vaccine program to prevent herpes zoster in older adults. Effectiveness of influenza vaccination on the medical utilization of frail older people (W.J. Lee): Influenza, a vaccine preventable disease, is a highly communicable disease that causes substantial hospitalization and mortality for the elderly. Immunosenescence and functional impairment diminish the immune response of influenza vaccine, in terms of lower serological antibody titers, which affect the efficacy and effectiveness of vaccines. The effectiveness of influenza vaccine is well-established on well-being people, and is proven ineffective for disable institutional residents. Benefits of influenza vaccination remain unclear on frail older people. We used a longitudinal health insurance database, with a population-based retrospective cohort study design, to evaluate the effectiveness of influenza vaccination against hospitalization and mortality on frail elderly people. The frailty was defined by the Adjusted Clinical Groups. In total, 5063 frail seniors were identified in a baseline period between Jan 1, 2005 and Dec 31, 2005. All subjects were followed up till Dec 31, 2009. Age, gender, socioeconomic status, living areas, use of annual health examinations, comorbid conditions, use of influenza vaccine, hospitalization, and mortality in the observation period were all collected for analysis. The effectiveness was presented as comparing ever versus never vaccinated people during the entire study period without regard to seasons. Compared with those without influenza vaccination, vaccinated elderly individuals were younger, more likely to be men, have higher socioeconomic status, live in rural areas, have a higher rate of receiving a health examination, and have similar medical conditions. In the Cox proportional hazards analysis, influenza vaccination reduced by 7% the risk of hospitalization (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86-0.99) and by 44% the risk of mortality (95% CI 0.51-0.62). Based on the results of our study, influenza vaccination was effective against hospitalization and mortality among the frail elderly. These results uphold the current universal influenza vaccination policy, and encourage policymakers to adopt strategies to improve vaccination use.

N2  - Background: An unwelcome guest after the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti was the shocking emergence of cholera. Four months after the earthquake, 215936 cases had been reported and of these 4131 patients had been infected and died. Mathematical models have been developed to predict the spread of cholera across the entire country and to explore the effects of disease-control interventions. Methods & Materials: Objective: to predict the timing and spread of regional cholera epidemics in Haiti using a mathematical model and to examine the efficacy of disease-controlled interventions. Design(s): A mathematical model was employed showing personto- person within and between the 10 geographic regions of the country. Data was obtained from Haitian hospitalization sources plus the 2009 census data. The model involves both waterborne and person-to-person transmission of cholera in order to predict its spread across the country. The model also attempts to assess the effects of 2 distinct interventions, namely vacination on a limited scale and the provision of clean water. Result(s): The model predicted a rate of transmission between 2.06 to 2.78 and this closely matched empirical observations. The model also suggested an intervention would reduce the risk of cholera spreading by 3%, and this was estimated to be twice the reduction that would result from simply implementing clean water to the same number of individuals. Although the model purports to project the spread of cholera and offer an intervention, it also acknowledges cholera continuing to take a toll on the population for the near future. Conclusion(s): Despite limited surveillance data, the model comes close to reported disease patterns. The model is a tool that planners can use to manage the epidemic, gain insights into the behavior of this infectious disease, and provide a useful tool for decision making. The possibility of eradicating cholera is yet to be determined. Should cholera become epidemic in Haiti, it will represent a threat to other countries in the region.

N2  - Background: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is one of the most serious Transboundary, infectious disease. It is a mosquito-borne viral zoonotics disease, causes periodic severe epidemics, characterized by high mortality rate of young animals and abortion in pregnant ruminants. Many risks factors are associated with the emergence of RVF Movement of infected animals,Environmental conditions.The modification of the Ecosystem.Demographic change of human. Objective(s): To determine potential risk factors associated with RVF occurrence in Central Sudan. Methods & Materials: Study area: The study was conducted on sheep, goats and cattle herds in Central Sudan. fx Study design: Study population The study was primarily focused on sheep and goats herd as reference or target population. Sampling frame and sample size Determination: Cross sectional study design was carried out to determine the seroprevalence of RVF in small ruminants in 2007. Serum sample was collected, using multistage random sampling technique. Blood samples were collected identifying sheep and goats from designated geographic localities in the study area.Serological diagnosis was carried out on collected specimens to demonstrate the presence of IgM immunoglobulines by ELISA. RVF sero-prevalence was estimated by calculating the proportion of the positive cases by the test as nominator and sampled population of sheep and goats as denominator in the study area at given point in time. Statistical data analysis: The collected data was organized and managed using relevant statistical software package for social sciences (SPSS). To investigate risk factors associated with RVF, the data was analyzed by univariate analysis using the Chi Square test. Result(s): States Involved in the Study, Samples Tested, Caprine, Ovine and Bovine by IgM Captured ELISA (Table presented) Conclusion(s): The overall prevalence of RVF in Central Sudan was 40.2%. The highest prevalence was recorded in Gezira state as well as Sinnar state, while the lowest prevalence was recorded in Blue Nile state. Univariate analysis revealed that there is now significant association of state and species with sero-positivity of RVF. While multivariate model showed that goats are associated with seropositivity of RVF.

N2  - Background: Adult studies have shown that outbreaks in nosocomial infections are associated with understaffing and overcrowding. However, no study has assessed the impact of nurse overtime and patient volume in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on neonatal nosocomial bacteremia. Objective(s): The objective of this study was to assess the impact of patient volume and nurse overtime on neonatal nosocomial bacteremia in all infants hospitalised in the NICU. Design/Methods: We conducted a retrospective study on all infants (n=7473) admitted in the CHU de Quebec NICU (capacity of 51 beds) from April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2013. Administrative data (nursing overtime hours per day, patient census per day) were obtained from the database Logibec, patient information was obtained from Med-Echo and information on neonatal nosocomial bacteremia was obtained from the local infectious disease database TDR. We assessed the association between administrative data and patient outcomes by using logit and probit models. Result(s): The average patient volume as percentage of capacity during the study period was 98.7+/-6.5%. The average overtime as percentage of total daily hours of work was 4.0+/-3.4%. Overtime is positively related to occupancy levels. For every increase of occupation by one patient, there was an increase of 1.65 h of overtime per day (P<0.001). There were a total of 306 events of nosocomial bacteremia during the study period. Coagulase-negative staphylococcus caused 82% of infections. The overall risk of nosocomial bacteremia was 4.2%. The total number of regular worked hours was not associated with a higher risk of infection. Higher overtime (expressed as percentage of total worked hours) was significantly associated with an increased risk of nosocomial bacteremia (P=0.02). Also, days when overtime was >8% of total worked hours, are significantly associated with an increase risk of nosocomial bacteremia (OR 1.51 [95% CI 1.10 to 2.08]; P=0.01). There was a trend between higher patient volume (100% occupancy compared to 90% capacity) and higher risk of nosocomial bacteremia (OR=1.60; P=0.08). Conclusion(s): In our study, high patient volume and nursing overtime was directly associated with a higher risk of nosocomial bacteremia in the NICU. This suggests that re-organising the medical workforce to better adapt to periods of high activity in the NICU should become an integral part of nosocomial infection prevention.

N2  - Zoonotic prion transmission occurred during the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic, with over 200 cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans diagnosed to date. Transmission of BSE to humans was not anticipated, and assessing the risk of cross-species prion transmission remains challenging. The transmission of infectious prions into different host species requires compatible PrP primary structures, and even one heterologous residue at a pivotal position can block prion infection. We and others have found that residues within the beta2-alpha2 loop region (residues 165-175) markedly impact conversion by sheep scrapie, BSE, mouse-adapted prions, CWD, and hamster-adapted prions. The tyrosine residue at position 169 is strictly conserved among mammals and the aromatic side chain is essential to maintain a 310-helical turn within the loop. Here we examined the impact of a Y169G substitution together with the S170N, N174T "rigid loop" substitutions on in vivo prion transmission and in vitro conversion. We found that transgenic mice expressing the Y169G, S170N, and N174T substitutions completely resisted infection with two strains of mouse prions and with deer CWD prions. To define how the single amino acid substitutions at positions 169, 170 or 174 impact conversion, we used variant PrPCs having single residue substitutions in the beta2-alpha2 loop as a substrate for in vitro prion conversion experiments. PrPC variants were expressed by transient transfection of immortalized RK13 (rabbit kidney) cells and possessed posttranslational modifications including the glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchor and glycosylation. The single Y169G substitution strongly inhibited conversion by mouse prions in vitro, and further investigations revealed that substitution of leucine or glutamine at position 169 also reduced conversion. In contrast, replacing the 169 tyrosine with the aromatic residues phenylalanine or tryptophan supported efficient prion conversion. We propose a model based on a requirement for tightly interdigitating complementary amino acid side chains within specific domains of adjacent PrP molecules, known as "steric zippers", to explain these results. Collectively, these studies suggest that an aromatic residue at position 169 supports efficient prion conversion.

T1  - Cost of care of CF, and how to treat patients in low resource settings?

N2  - The cost of care of CF is increasing due to the use of new technologies and innovative drug treatments. However, research on the cost of care of patients with cystic fibrosis is scarce. The cost of CF care varies substantially between countries depending on their national health system and their socioeconomic conditions. Here we present the data of the cost of care for CF patients from 2 major CF centers in Israel and compare them with data published from Europe, Canada, and the USA. The CF center in Jerusalem is routinely caring for CF patients fromthe Palestinian territories and from other countries with poor socioeconomic conditions, e.g. South America or Russia. In order to help the patients to lower the cost of treatment in their home settings we developed a low cost treatment plan. In this lecture I will also present our guide for CF treatments in low resource settings. Newborn Screening-What To Do with Newly Diagnosed Infants Isabelle Sermet-Gaudelus, on behalf of the french working group for Neonatal screening in Cystic Fibrosis. Service de Pneumologie Pediatrique. Hopital Necker Enfants Malades, Paris. INSERM U 1151. Faculte Paris V. The successful expansion of newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) has highlighted the need for clear guidance on the management of screenpositive infants.Several guidelines have been published aiming to harmonize the care of infants diagnosed with a typical form of CF at neonatal screening, including in US, Europe and France (1,2,3). These guidelines agree about general statements for management of care at diagnosis and describe nutritional, digestive and respiratory monitoring and treatment during the 2 first years of life. General statements Infants with CF must receive care in an accredited CF care center. They must be reviewed in clinic by the team every 4-8 weeks, and more frequently after diagnosis, for ex once a month during the first 6 months of age, every 2 months until 1 year of age, and every 3 months thereafter (3). After initial diagnosis, the CF center should contact the primary care professionals who will assure the regular ambulatory follow-up to implement therapeutic strategy. Parents of infants with CF should be offered access to genetic advice and counseling. The standard childhood immunization schedule must be applied in accordance with national guidelines. Anti-influenza vaccination is recommended for the infant from the 6th month of life and all household members and healthcare providers. French guidelines also state that vaccination against chicken pox could be recommended. Nutritional statements Content, timing of baseline nutritional assessment and nutritional goal is still not consensual. Significant differences in local practice exist. According to European statements, growth targets should reflect genetic potential, sibling height and local population demographics (1). French guidelines recommend to catch-up birth weight percentile at 6 months (3). At 2 years, weight-for-height should be at the 50th percentile and height at the target height percentile (target height: average of the height of the 2 parents plus 6.5 cm for boys and minus 6.5 cm for girls) (3). Energy intake should be performed by a dietetician on a regular basis and adapted to achieve the objectives of weight-for-height growth. Energy intake could be as much as 150% of the daily recommended calorie intake for the same age in the general population (4). Breast feeding is encouraged, all the more that recent data acknowledge its protective effect against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection (4, 5). Formula with hydrolysed cow's milk protein is only recommended in infants with risks of malabsorption, or severe undernourishment. Sodium chloride supplementation must be systematic, particularly in the case of breast feeding and should be adapted to natriuresis (6). It should be increased during periods of hot weather and all other causes of high salt loss (diarrhea, fever, ileostomy). At initial diagnosis, infants must have pancreatic function assessed by stool fecal elastase. If elastase is normal, repeat assessment is recommended. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy should be started at diagnosis in case of clinical symptoms of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency even before obtaining the results of the elastase assay. The initial dose could be 2.000 IU lipase per 100 ml of milk. In case of persistence of symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency despite a maximum dose of 10.000 UI/kg/day of lipase, it may be necessary to evaluate patient's compliance and the methods of conservation and administration of the pancreatic extracts. In case of poor weight-for-height growth despite an adapted substitutive pancreatic opotherapy, an evaluation is necessary including a dietetic review, a search for sodium insufficiency and other etiologies of malabsorption. In case of persistence of symptoms of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency despite a maximum dose of 10.000 UI/kg/day of lipase and in the absence of other etiologies, the administration of gastric secretion inhibitors may be envisaged. Respiratory statements Bacterial cultures of bronchial flora should be performed at each session of physiotherapy or in case of abnormal clinical status either on bronchial secretions (expectorated or obtained by sputum induction) or by pharyngeal swab (7). A chest X-ray should be performed at baseline and annual assessment, and, in case of clinical abnormality. High Resolution Computed Tomography could complete the assessment in case of clinical or radiological abnormality and/or at initial assessment according to local practice to detect early bronchiectasis (8). Systematic respiratory physiotherapy is recommended from the time of diagnosis. The frequency of sessions of physiotherapy depends on the clinical status of the infant. Regular therapy might be recommended even in the asymptomatic infant (3). Any evidence of respiratory infection justifies performing a respiratory culture and adapted antibiotic treatment of the isolated pathogens. Infection by Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to Meticillin should be treated by adapted antibiotherapy. In case of isolation of S.aureus resistant toMeticillin, a treatment aimed at eradication is recommended. Evidence of P.aeruginosa justifies systematic antibiotic treatment aimed at eradication, even in the asymptomatic infant. Although there is still no consensus on the topic, treatment might begin with an inhaled antibiotic, eventually associated with oral Ciprofloxacin. In case of persistence of P. aeruginosa after initial therapy, or if the infant presents with severe clinical signs, intravenous antibiotics should be considered (1,2,3). For other pathogens, there is less clear agreement and treatment should be guided by local policies. In the absence of clinical improvement despite an adapted antibiotherapy, bronchial sampling by bronchoalveolar lavage should be considered and non-infectious causes should be searched for, notably gastro-oesophageal reflux, asthma and an ENT cause. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) may have adverse effects on respiratory status in patients with CF (9). There is insufficient evidence to support systematic recommendation of Palivuzimab in the Cystic Fibrosis infant. However, extrapolation of data from other populations suggests that there could be benefit from the use of RSV prophylaxis in infants with CF (10). US and French guidelines state that Palivizumab could be discussed, namely for the infant of less than 6months of age during an epidemic period (2,3). Finally, dornase alfa, 7% hypertonic saline might be used in symptomatic infants according to the CF America, Foundation guidelines (2). Conclusion With increasing numbers of infants with CF being diagnosed by newborn screening across most of Europe and in North America, we will have the opportunity for large randomised controlled trials. There is an urgent need for best available evidence to harmonize therapeutic strategy in infants newly diagnosed with the final aimto improve clinical status at later ages.

N2  - Background: Frequent donor travels and environmental changes increase the risk of mosquito-transmitted human flavivirus infection in Europe. The increased infection rates in the population leads to a potential increased risk of contaminated blood products. During the recent West Nile Virus (WNV) epidemics, several European countries implemented a 1 month deferral for blood donors traveling in risk regions. The lack of epidemiological data prevents country specific risk-benefit based deferral decisions to be made, with a particular focus on the blood supply. Aim(s): The introduction of a donor travel monitoring system to assess the impact on blood supply of the 1 month deferral policy applied to donors traveling abroad. Method(s): WNV deferral was introduced in Switzerland between 1 July-30 November 2013 for all travelers to WNV affected European countries, including areas affected in 2012, with exception of Italy (regional deferral after confirmation of the first case in the region). Between 1 July-31 December a seasonal monitoring system recording donor travels abroad notified by medical questionnaire and by phone was introduced. All travels in the month before the blood donation visit were recorded and deferral rates in and outside Europe calculated. Additional deferral rates of donors contacting us in advance by phone were estimated. For the 5 most frequently visited countries the potential deferral rates and the time interval between return and donation visit was calculated. Result(s): From 13.7% of the 45'865 donations performed between 1 July-31 December 2013 the donor travelled abroad within a month before their donation: 1.1% outside and 12.6% within Europa. During this period the WNV deferral rate for travels outside Europe was 0.5%. During WNV epidemics (July until November), deferral rate for travels in Europe was 1.0% without Italy and Austria, and WNV deferrals worldwide were 1.5% of 39'293 donations. Additional donors deferred by phone before their visits were 1.1%: 0.6% for travels outside and 0.5% inside Europe. According to our donor travel data, a 'whole country' deferral rule in one of the 5 most visited countries would result in additional higher deferrals than the current global rate: 2.6% for Italy, 2.1% for France, 1.7% for Spain, 3.5% for Germany, and 1.0% for Austria. On average a donor donates blood 13 days after their return from abroad, thus only an additional 17 days deferral is necessary for these donors. Conclusion(s): Emerging diseases challenge the blood supply of the directly affected and neighboring countries. During the second half of 2013 the global deferral rate for WNV <2% did not lead to a blood shortage, and the simple 'whole country' (instead regional) deferral police of the Swiss Blood Transfusion Services had virtually no impact on blood supply in our region. Future deferral of donors traveling frequently to affected areas will be challenging if WNV epidemics evolve. Monitoring donor travel and deferral rates is an essential tool required to plan realistic measures and effective alternatives to current deferral policies, such as the mobilization of new donors, additional blood collections, or infectious disease testing.

N2  - Background: HIV was discovered in the spring of 1984, with high rates of virus isolation and antibody (Ab) detection in AIDS patients. Early studies demonstrating isolation of similar strains of HIV in transfusion recipients and linked infected donors contributed to proof that HIV was the cause of AIDS, and established the critical need to develop tests for blood screening. Aims/Methods: Review evolution of HIV donor screening, and broader applications of HIV tests and infected donor surveillance to research and public health. Result(s): In mid-1984 scientists in governments and industry collaborated to develop HIV Ab tests that were implemented in blood banks ~1 year following discovery of HIV. Look-back studies triggered by detection of Ab+ donors found that ~90% of recipients transfused with Ab+ blood were infected, indicating high rates of persistent infection/infectivity in seropositive donors. Retrospective analyses estimated that incidence of donor infection and consequent transfusion-transmitted (TT)-HIV in high risk cities like San Francisco rose rapidly from 1978 to a peak in 1982 of ~1%/unit, followed by a decline to 0.1% at implementation of Ab screening. Initial Ab screening did not eliminate TT-HIV, with numerous breakthrough cases detected shortly following introduction of first-generation assays. Analyses of transmission rates by prior donations from seroconverting donors yielded estimates for an infectious window period (WP) of ~56 days prior to detection by first-generation Ab assays. Improvements in sensitivity of second-generation tests in the late-1980s and third-generation tests in the mid-1990s reduced the pre-Ab-seroconversion WP to approximately 3 weeks. Subsequent additions of p24 antigen and then nucleic acid technology (NAT) screening in the late 1990s closed the infectious WP to 5-10 days, resulting in current risk estimates of approximately 1 infectious unit per 1-2 million transfusions in the US and other countries where NAT screening is performed, including high incidence settings like South Africa and South-East Asia where individual-donation NAT screening has been adopted. However, rare transmissions of HIV by NAT-negative blood indicate that even sensitive NAT and serological screening cannot eliminate HIV risk, both due to high infectivity of virus in the early ramp-up phase of acute infection and rare failures of assays to detect genetically diverse strains of HIV. NAT screening assays and algorithms and fourth-generation Ag/Ab serological tests developed for blood bank screening and staging early HIV infections are now in widespread use in clinical diagnostic, research and public health settings. NAT assays developed for donor screening have been applied not only to detect acute infections, but also for studies of patients on HAART and 'elite controllers' involved in 'HIV-eradication' studies to detect and quantify persistent low-level viral replication. Conclusion(s): Beyond advancing blood safety, advances in HIV testing have contributed to HIV diagnostics, research and public health. Further opportunities to cross-fertilize transfusion medicine and HIV research and surveillance include establishing a global program to characterize incident HIV infections in donors (risk factors, clades, resistance profiles) to help monitor the pulse of the epidemic, and referral of acutely infected donors to research programs focused on understanding this critical phase of infection.

N2  - The stabilization of the HIV epidemic in Africa has uncovered new epidemic of HIV associated comorbidities including cancers which the poorly developed health care system, poor infrastructure and lack of personnel is unable to cope with. In November 2012, international leaders in Cancer Research and Policy from 15 countries met at the NIH, Bethesda and made recommendations about the interventions needed to respond to the global cancer challenge in the world. These include (a) Creation of reliable, population-based registries that define the incidence, mortality, and survival rates of different types of cancers (b) Implementation of prevention measures to mitigate factors now known to promote cancer-tobacco, certain infectious agents, ultraviolet radiation, alcohol, obesity, lack of exercise, and diet, (c) Screening individuals for certain cancers (of the cervix, breast, prostate, and colorectum, in particular) and (d) Optimal cancer treatment. In this presentation, I will highlight how the Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland (IHV) and the Institute of Human Virology Nigeria (IHVN) working with partners in Nigeria and internationally have implemented these recommendations and present data illustrating the outcome of our interventions. For example, Since 2010, 21 cancer registries have been developed or re-strengthened in Nigeria and 3 of these have met the WHO criteria for population based cancer registration (PBCR). These registries are now able to contribute data to the global cancer incidence database after more than 30 years during which there was no data from Nigeria. With mainstreaming of an additional 3 PBCR this year, we would have increased the proportion of Africa covered by PBCR from 11% to 32%. Our results also correct distortions in the estimates of cancer incidence and mortality in Nigeria which was previously based on projections derived from data from cancer registries of other African countries that had been used in the past Cervical cancer is the commonest female cancer in Africa and in women living with HIV/AIDS. Implementation of screening programs has reduced incidence in developed countries by 80% in recent decades but incidence in developing countries remain stable or has been increasing. IHV implements an innovative "screen and treat" with immediate treatment with cold coagulation, digital cervicography for QA/QC and web based consultation for second opinion for early detection of cervical cancer. In collaboration with the Nigerian authorities and other partners, this program plans to reach 1,000,000 Nigerian women with at least 1 lifetime screening event over the next 10 years. This screening project laid the foundation for the NIH funded African Collaborative Center for Microbiome and Genomics Research (ACCME), part of the Wellcome Trust and NIH funded H3Africa initiative, which we set up at the IHVN and is currently engaged in integrative epidemiology of cervical cancer that is exploring the host and viral genomics and epigenomics, somatic cervical cancer genomics as part of NIH led Cancer Genome Atlas mapping project (TCGA), vaginal microenvironment - innate immunity and vaginal microbiota, as well as detailed risk factor characterization of prevalent and persistent HPV infection. Preliminary results from early studies conducted at this Center will be presented. Because of dearth of systematic information about the epidemiology of AIDS Associated Cancers in Africa, we have created a matched prospective cohort of persons living with HIV/AIDS and healthy volunteers who are being followed up every 2 years with detailed clinical evaluation and collection of data and biological samples in order to improve knowledge of the epidemiology of HIV Associated Comorbidities and provide high quality biological samples for molecular and omics studies. In my presentation, I will also mention some of the trainings that we have conducted, research into other cancer risk factors and the work we are doing to map the infrastructural needs for oncology treatment in Nigeria.

T1  - Preventing transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases in spain: Is our blood safe enough?

N2  - Blood safety is achieved by means of adequate donor selection, sensitive blood screening tests and pathogen reduction technologies. These three factors are combined into a difficult equation where other variables are also included: costeffectiveness, legal requirements, available technology, social perception of the risk, local epidemiology, emerging threats, etc. From the past history of HIV and hepatitis C transmission, the blood safety equation has been designed to prevent by all possible means transmission of HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus. In Spain as in many other countries, all blood donations are screened for HIV RNA, HCV RNA and HBV DNA by ultrasensitive nucleic acid amplification technologies (NAT). NAT screening is aimed to prevent viral transmission through donations in serological window phase (WP). When HCV NAT was implemented for the first time, there were concerns about the cost-effectiveness of the measure. After more than ten year experience in Spain, NAT screening has interdicted 32 HCV WP (1 in 550,000 donations), 38 HIV-1 WP (1 in 390,000) and 60 HBV WP (1 in 190,000) (Data from the TTID-working group of the Spanish Society of Blood transfusion, updated to December 2012). Spanish blood centers have a ten-fold higher NAT yield cases as compared to Northern Europe and North America. In our Regional Transfusion Center in Catalonia, we could calculate the residual risk of HCV, HIV and HBV transmission after NAT implementation that was set in 1 per 32 millions donations for HCV, 1 per 1.6 million donations for HIV and 1 in 200,000 donations for HBV. Therefore, the theoretical residual risk of viral transmission might be considered negligible for HCV, moderate for HIV and still high for HBV. Undisclosed risk factors for HIV and HBV acquisition during the predonation interview may explain the higher risk. Another effect of NAT screening is the identification of donors that carry occult hepatitis B infection. In Spain, anti-HBc screening is not mandatory and, as a consequence, ultrasensitive NAT identifies low level HBV DNA replication in anti-HBc positive blood donors. Since HBV NAT implementation, 497 blood donors with occult hepatitis B infection have been identified (1 in 22,000 donations). Most of them are regular donors, otherwise healthy subjects, and the infectivity of the previously transfused blood components is still controversial. Chagas disease is also an issue for blood safety in Spain, due to the massive arrival of Latin America immigrants during the past decade. Chagas disease is caused by a zoonotic parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, that is endemic to Central and South America, especially Bolivia. Contrary to HIV/HCV/HBV NAT and serology screening, anti-T. cruzi screening is performed only in at-risk donors, defined by the Spanish regulation (RD 2005/1088) as being born or resident in endemic areas or whose mother was born in endemic areas. Chagas screening is therefore an example of selective testing based in donors' questionnaire. Since 2005, when Chagas testing became mandatory, the Spanish Hemovigilance system has reported 3 cases of post-transfusion Chagas disease. Failure to correctly identify at-risk donors during the pre-donation interview may have fatal consequences to immunosuppressed blood recipients. Blood safety is compromised by globalization. Chagas disease is a good example but also any infectious disease outbreak that appears locally can be transported rapidly to any other place in the world within hours. Therefore, we all need to be prepared for an unknown infectious agent to cause a major disruption in blood supply because, applying the precautionary principle, blood transmission is always to be suspected. And the outbreaks are more frequent every year. We all remember the Chikungunya virus epidemic in Reunion Island back in 2006 or the West Nile Virus (WNV) rapid spread in North America in 1999. The Chikungunya virus and WNV virus appeared recently in Northern Italy, causing seasonal outbreaks coinciding with the mosquitoes activity. Every year we need to react to different epidemiological threats coming from all over the world and closing the circle around Spain and other European countries. Two WNV clinical cases were identified in South Spain in 2010, and WNV has become endemic to Northern Italy, Greece, Romania and many former Soviet Republics. Dengue virus is widely spread in the Caribbean Islands and many regions in South America and caused an outbreak in Madeira in 2012. It is paramount to deal rapidly with the risk and modify donors' selection criteria accordingly. In our experience, one month deferral to donors traveling outside the European countries helps deal with most viral outbreaks (Dengue, Chikungunya, WNV). Nevertheless, during the summer season, weekly updates must be distributed to the blood collection facilities in order to deal with the outbreaks within Europe. Emerging infections are not the only threat to blood safety. Concerns have risen recently regarding hepatitis E virus and its relevance in blood safety. There are a few cases of proven post-transfusion hepatitis E infections, described mainly in Asian countries. Recent studies report consistent data on high HEV exposure and evidence of HEV active infection among European blood donors. Immunosuppressed patients, such a solid organ recipients, may carry chronic hepatitis E infection leading to severe liver damage. In view of this situation, some voices have already demanded that blood is screened for HEV. In any case, there is need of more studies to assess the true impact of HEV transmission through blood component and plasma derivates The Hemovigilance system in Spain has reported only a few post-transfusion infections in the past years. However, in view of the threats, the old ones and the new ones, the circle around blood safety is still open.

N2  - Background: Since the late 1990s there has been a sharp rise in cases of syphilis in many UK inner cities; majority occur in men who have sex with men (MSM) and more than half were known to be HIV positive. In early 2011 an outbreak of infectious syphilis was identified in a rural county, one of the least densely populated in England. This was on a background of stable low incidence in the area. Many presented with 'balanitis' only. Method(s): Relevant information was obtained from the clinical notes and laboratory data of patients diagnosed with infectious syphilis between January 2011 and December 2013. Result(s): 50 cases were identified, one woman and 49 men. Like in other areas, majority [44, (88%)] occurred in MSM; however our cohort showed low HIV positivity [9, (18%)]. Of these, one patient was diagnosed with HIV and syphilis concurrently; the rest had pre-existing HIV infection. 24 patients were symptomatic of which 13 presented with symptoms and signs suggestive of balanitis without obvious genital ulcer, rash or other clinical manifestations of syphilis. Discussion(s): Relevant areas of interest are as follows: (1) the rural nature of the county (2) significant proportion of patients presenting with 'balanitis' (only) which is a relatively common condition seen in patients attending sexual health clinics (3) many bisexual men identified themselves as heterosexuals; some admitted to MSM activity during further questioning after the syphilis diagnosis (4) low HIV positivity. This article is aimed at drawing the attention of this outbreak to other sexual health providers especially those in rural areas so that they may exercise a high index of suspicion of infectious syphilis in patients presenting with 'balanitis' as some of them may not divulge MSM activity. The true burden of the infection in this rural county is likely to be higher than estimated. Conclusion(s): Syphilis outbreak occurs in major cities as well as rural counties. In rural areas, patients may not identify themselves as MSM and therefore may not perceive themselves at risk of sexually transmitted infections. Such patients are unlikely to attend sexual health clinics. Patients with syphilis can present with 'balanitis' without other characteristic symptoms and signs of syphilis. Improving accessibility to the clinic and effective patient engagement will increase the chances of syphilis diagnosis. (Table Presented).

N2  - Introduction: Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella ssp (CPKs) are considered emerging killers in profoundly immunocompromised patients, especially in those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). From literature data, CPK-related infectious mortality is estimated to be approximately 50%, one of the highest due to multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens. Such a gloomy picture is caused by CPK resistance to multiple antimicrobial classes, including all available beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. Materials (or patients) and Methods: Following a CPK outbreak in our Center, from July 2011 to November 2013, we surveyed the epidemiology of Gram-negative MDR pathogens through active surveillance with rectal swabs in a series of patients suffering from hematological malignancies. To unveil asymptomatic carriers at risk of subsequent clinical disease, we performed a total of 1783 rectal swabs in 267 consecutive patients. Result(s): Eighty-nine patients out of 267 were found colonized with Gram-negative MDR pathogens (64 after allogeneic and 12 after autologous HSCT, and 13 after chemotherapy only). Among these 89 patients, 27 harbored CPKs, 23 carbapenemase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 25 ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, 10 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 8 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter spp and 13 other pathogens. Some heavily pretreated patients were positive for two or more pathogens. During a 3-year observation period, we documented 12 CPK-related sepsis (1 before and 10 after allogeneic HSCT, and 1 after autologous HSCT). Seven patients subsequently developed septic shock and 4 of them died of multi-organ failure, resulting in an overall CPK-related mortality of 33%. The risk of CPK sepsis did not correlate with age, disease type and stage at transplant or Sorror's comorbidity index. Seventy-five percent of isolated CPKs showed sensibility to colistin and gentamicin. To reduce mortality due to Gram-negative MDR pathogens, from June 2012 we modified our internal guidelines by early initiating a triple antimicrobial therapy with colistin, tigeciclin and meropenem in all febrile patients with hemodinamic instability. All CPK-colonized patients were additionally put into reverse isolation. Following these preventive measures, in 2013 CPK sepsis was documented only in two patients, both surviving without septic shock. Discussion(s): In conclusion, the availability of rectal swabs, the prompt initiation of appropriate combined antimicrobial therapy in patients carrying Gram-negative MDR pathogens and the timely reverse isolation of all CPK-positive cases, may reduce infectious mortality and improve the overall outcome after HSCT.

T1  - The importance of contact network assumptions in epidemic simulation models

N2  - Anthropological research into the cultural, biological and demographic impacts of epidemics across time and space demonstrates the importance of infectious disease in human populations. However, practical and ethical complications hinder research on the introduction and spread of diseases in living groups. Therefore, models are frequently used to study this process. Different techniques require certain assumptions and simplifications, which affect model results and interpretations, but these techniques are rarely systematically compared. This poster presents a comparison of two modeling approaches that are gaining in importance: agent-based simulations and social network models. The models are used to study the spread of the 1918 influenza pandemic in the small community of Newell's Island, Newfoundland and Labrador. In these models, disease parameters, community structure and transmission processes are kept as similar as possible in order to focus on the differences that result from how relationships and interactions are considered. In the agent-based model, a dynamic contact network emerges from individual movement to social spaces related to age and sex-specific behaviors. In the social network model, contacts based on these behaviors and other relationships are established prior to and held mostly constant during simulations. Results indicate that, on average, the social network model produces larger, faster epidemics than the agent-based model, and there are opposite trends observed between the two models in the number of individuals driving epidemics at varying transmission probabilities. These comparisons demonstrate the importance of the assumptions used in disease models when addressing various research questions.

T1  - A Bayesian SIRS model for the analysis of respiratory syncytial virus in the region of Valencia, Spain
A1  - Corberan-Vallet A.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - We present a Bayesian stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) model in discrete time to understand respiratory syncytial virus dynamics in the region of Valencia, Spain. A SIRS model based on ordinary differential equations has also been proposed to describe RSV dynamics in the region of Valencia. However, this continuous-time deterministic model is not suitable when the initial number of infected individuals is small. Stochastic epidemic models based on a probability of disease transmission provide a more natural description of the spread of infectious diseases. In addition, by allowing the transmission rate to vary stochastically over time, the proposed model provides an improved description of RSV dynamics. The Bayesian analysis of the model allows us to calculate both the posterior distribution of the model parameters and the posterior predictive distribution, which facilitates the computation of point forecasts and prediction intervals for future observations.

N2  - Many economically important cattle diseases spread between herds through livestock movements. Traditionally, most transmission models have assumed that all purchased cattle carry the same risk of generating outbreaks in the destination herd. Using data on bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) in Scotland as a case example, this study provides empirical and theoretical evidence that the risk of disease transmission varies substantially based on the animal and herd demographic characteristics at the time of purchase. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that purchasing pregnant heifers and open cows sold with a calf at foot were associated with an increased risk of beef herds being seropositive for BVDV. Based on the results from a dynamic within-herd simulation model, these findings may be partly explained by the age-related probability of animals being persistently infected with BVDV as well as the herd demographic structure at the time of animal introductions. There was also evidence that an epidemiologically important network statistic, "betweenness centrality" (a measure frequently associated with the potential for herds to acquire and transmit disease), was significantly higher for herds that supplied these particular types of replacement beef cattle. The trends for dairy herds were not as clear, although there was some evidence that open heifers and open lactating cows were associated with an increased risk of BVDV. Overall, these findings have important implications for developing simulation models that more accurately reflect the industry-level transmission dynamics of infectious cattle diseases.

T1  - Animal Models of Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli Infection
A1  - Ritchie J.M. 
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - The first major outbreaks caused by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) raised public and medical awareness of the risks associated with acquiring this potentially deadly infection. The widespread presence of these organisms in the environment, the severity of the clinical sequelae, and the lack of treatment options and effective preventive measures demand that we obtain a better understanding of how this group of organisms cause disease. Animal models allow study of the processes and factors that contribute to disease and, as such, form a valuable tool in the repertoire of infectious disease researchers. Yet despite more than 30 years of research, it seems that no single model host reproduces the full spectrum of clinical disease induced by EHEC in humans. In the first part of this review, a synopsis of what is known about EHEC infections is garnered from human outbreaks and biopsy specimens. The main features and limitations of EHEC infection models that are based on the three most commonly used species (pigs, rabbits, and mice) are described within a historical context. Recent advances are highlighted, and a brief overview of models based on other species is given. Finally, the impact of the host on moderating EHEC infection is considered in light of growing evidence for the need to consider the biology and virulence strategies of EHEC in the context of its niche within the intestine.

N2  - Fitting models with Bayesian likelihood-based parameter inference is becoming increasingly important in infectious disease epidemiology. Detailed datasets present the opportunity to identify subsets of these data that capture important characteristics of the underlying epidemiology. One such dataset describes the epidemic of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in British cattle, which is also an important exemplar of a disease with a wildlife reservoir (the Eurasian badger). Here, we evaluate a set of nested dynamic models of bTB transmission, including individual- and herd-level transmission heterogeneity and assuming minimal prior knowledge of the transmission and diagnostic test parameters. We performed a likelihood-based bootstrapping operation on the model to infer parameters based only on the recorded numbers of cattle testing positive for bTB at the start of each herd outbreak considering high- and low-risk areas separately. Models without herd heterogeneity are preferred in both areas though there is some evidence for super-spreading cattle. Similar to previous studies, we found low test sensitivities and high within-herd basic reproduction numbers (R0), suggesting that there may be many unobserved infections in cattle, even though the current testing regime is sufficient to control within-herd epidemics in most cases. Compared with other, more data-heavy approaches, the summary data used in our approach are easily collected, making our approach attractive for other systems.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Wildlife diseases are increasingly recognized as a major threat to biodiversity. Chytridiomycosis is an emerging infectious disease of amphibians caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Using a mathematical model and simulations, we study its effects on a generic riparian host population with a tadpole and adult life stage. An analytical expression for the basic reproduction quotient, Qo, of the pathogen is derived. By sampling the entire relevant parameter space, we perform a statistical assessment of the importance of all considered parameters in determining the risk of host extinction, upon exposure to Bd. We find that Qo not only gives a condition for the initial invasion of the fungus, but is in fact the best predictor for host extinction. We also show that the role of tadpoles, which in some species tolerate infections, is ambivalent. While tolerant tadpoles may provide a reservoir for the fungus, thus facilitating its persistence or even amplifying its outbreaks, they can also act as a rescue buffer for a stressed host population. Our results have important implications for amphibian conservation efforts.

N2  - Salmonella is a major cause of bacterial foodborne disease. Human salmonellosis results in significant public health concerns and a considerable economic burden. Dairy cattle are recognized as a key source of several Salmonella serovars that are a threat to human health. To lower the risk of Salmonella infection, reduction of Salmonella prevalence in dairy cattle is important. Vaccination as a control measure has been applied for reduction of preharvest Salmonella prevalence on dairy farms. Salmonella vaccines are usually imperfect (i.e., vaccines may provide a partial protection for susceptible animals, reduce the infectiousness and shedding level, shorten the infectious period of infected animals, and/or curb the number of clinical cases), and evaluation of the potential impacts of imperfect Salmonella vaccines at the farm level is valuable to design effective intervention strategies. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of imperfect Salmonella vaccines on the stochastic transmission dynamics in an adult dairy herd. To this end, we developed a semi-stochastic and individual-based continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) vaccination model with both direct and indirect transmission, and applied the CTMC vaccination model to Salmonella Cerro transmission in an adult dairy herd. Our results show that vaccines shortening the infectious period are most effective in reducing prevalence, and vaccines decreasing host susceptibility are most effective in reducing the outbreak size. Vaccines with multiple moderate efficacies may have the same effectiveness as vaccines with a single high efficacy in reducing prevalence, time to extinction, and outbreak size. Although the environment component has negligible contributions to the prevalence, time to extinction, and outbreak size for Salmonella Cerro in the herd, the relative importance of environment component was not assessed. This study indicates that an effective vaccination program against Salmonella Cerro spread in the herd can be designed with (1) vaccines with a single high efficacy in reducing either the infectious period or susceptibility of the host, or (2) if such single high efficacy vaccines are not available, vaccines with multiple moderate efficacies may be considered instead. These findings are also of general value for designing vaccination program for Salmonella serotypes in livestock.

T1  - Worthy of their name: How floods drive outbreaks of two major floodwater mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae)
A1  - Berec L.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - An understanding of how climate variables drive seasonal dynamics of mosquito populations is critical to mitigating negative impacts of potential outbreaks, including both nuisance effects and risk of mosquito-borne infectious disease. Here,weidentify climate variables most affecting seasonal dynamics of two major floodwater mosquitoes, Aedes vexans (Meigen, 1830) and Aedes sticticus (Meigen, 1838) (Diptera: Culicidae), along the lower courses of the Dyje River, at the border between the Czech Republic and Austria. Monthly trap counts of both floodwater mosquitoes varied both across sites and years. Despite this variability, both models used to fit the observed data at all sites (and especially that for Ae. sticticus) and site-specific models fitted the observed data quite well. The most important climate variables we identified-temperature and especially flooding-were driving seasonal dynamics of both Aedes species. We suggest that flooding determines seasonal peaks in the monthly mosquito trap counts while temperature modulates seasonality in these counts. Hence, floodwater mosquitoes indeed appear worthy of their name. Moreover, the climate variables we considered for modeling were able reasonably to predict mosquito trap counts in the month ahead. Our study can help in planning flood management; timely notification of people, given that these mosquitoes are a real nuisance in this region; public health policy management to mitigate risk from such mosquito-borne diseases as that caused in humans by the Tahyna virus; and anticipating negative consequences of climate change, which are expected only to worsen unless floods, or the mosquitoes themselves, are satisfactorily managed. © 2014 Entomological Society of America.

T1  - Using multitype branching processes to quantify statistics of disease outbreaks in zoonotic epidemics
A1  - Singh S.
A1  - Schneider D.J.
A1  - Myers C.R. 
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Branching processes have served as a model for chemical reactions, biological growth processes, and contagion (of disease, information, or fads). Through this connection, these seemingly different physical processes share some common universalities that can be elucidated by analyzing the underlying branching process. In this work we focus on coupled branching processes as a model of infectious diseases spreading from one population to another. An exceedingly important example of such coupled outbreaks are zoonotic infections that spill over from animal populations to humans. We derive several statistical quantities characterizing the first spillover event from animals to humans, including the probability of spillover, the first passage time distribution for human infection, and disease prevalence in the animal population at spillover. Large stochastic fluctuations in those quantities can make inference of the state of the system at the time of spillover difficult. Focusing on outbreaks in the human population, we then characterize the critical threshold for a large outbreak, the distribution of outbreak sizes, and associated scaling laws. These all show a strong dependence on the basic reproduction number in the animal population and indicate the existence of a novel multicritical point with altered scaling behavior. The coupling of animal and human infection dynamics has crucial implications, most importantly allowing for the possibility of large human outbreaks even when human-to-human transmission is subcritical.

N2  - Background Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of extreme temperatures. Objective To examine the relationship between extreme temperatures and paediatric emergency department admissions (EDAs) in Brisbane, Australia, during 2003-2009. Methods A quasi-Poisson generalised linear model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the relationships between extreme temperatures and age-, gender- and cause-specific paediatric EDAs, while controlling for air pollution, relative humidity, day of the week, influenza epidemics, public holiday, season and long-term trends. The model residuals were checked to identify whether there was an added effect due to heat waves or cold spells. Results There were 131 249 EDAs among children during the study period. Both high (RR=1.27; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.44) and low (RR=1.81; 95% CI 1.66 to 1.97) temperatures were significantly associated with an increase in paediatric EDAs in Brisbane. Male children were more vulnerable to temperature effects. Children aged 0-4 years were more vulnerable to heat effects and children aged 10-14 years were more sensitive to both hot and cold effects. High temperatures had a significant impact on several paediatric diseases, including intestinal infectious diseases, respiratory diseases, endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, nervous system diseases and chronic lower respiratory diseases. Low temperatures were significantly associated with intestinal infectious diseases, respiratory diseases and endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases. An added effect of heat waves on childhood chronic lower respiratory diseases was seen, but no added effect of cold spells was found. Conclusions As climate change continues, children are at particular risk of a variety of diseases which might be triggered by extremely high temperatures. This study suggests that preventing the effects of extreme temperature on children with respiratory diseases might reduce the number of EDAs.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To survey on the vaccination of varicella live attenuated vaccine among 4-17 children in Minhang District, and analyze the protective effect against varicella., METHODS: We collected outbreak chickenpox cases reported from infectious disease report system and surveillance units in Minhang district from 1st May in 2012 to 30th Apr in 2013. The 1: 3 matched case-control study was conducted to questionnaire the legal guardian of the cases and control group, and calculate the protective effect and effective term of protection. The survey included vaccination, chickenpox exposure history, previous history of varicella illness, suffering from the symptoms of chickenpox, the vaccinations brand, etc. The criteria of accepted case were those healthy students who were in the same class with those chickenpox cases. The accepted matched controlling data were those children who were from the same class with outbreak chickenpox cases without varicelliform eruption, similar live condition, the closest house, the same gender, the closest age. This study investigated 390 cases of patients and the control group included 1 170 cases. Chi-square test was used to compare the vaccination of cases and controls, as well as the incidence of chickenpox vaccination different brands VarV, Mantel-Haenzel chi-square test was applied to compare the protective effect of the two groups., RESULTS: VarV overall vaccination rate was 68.3% (1 065/1 560), among them, the case group coverage was 45.1% (176/390), significantly lower than the control group (76.0% (889/1 170)) (chi2 = 128.55, P < 0.01). The coverage in children of 4-10 years old group was 88.4% (375/424), significantly higher than the 11-17 years old group (60.7% (690/1 136)) (chi2 = 109.40, P < 0.01). The overall protective effect of VarV was 78.10% (71.82%-82.98%).Vaccinated group incidence ratio was 16.5% (176/1 065), significantly lower than the unvaccinated group (43.2% (214/495)) (chi2 = 128.55, P < 0.01). The chickenpox risk of the children who were vaccinated was lower than those who were not, and the OR (95%CI) was 0.22(0.17-0.28) . Proportion of the fever and the typical symptoms of varicella zoster were 26.1% (46/176), 8.0% (14/176) in the children vaccinated VarV, significantly lower than children without VarV vaccination history (54.7% (117/214) , 18.2% (39/214) ) (chi2 values were 32.33 and 8.67, respectively. P values both <0.01). The varicella incidence was 17.4% (139/797) in children vaccinated domestic VarV, and it was 13.8% (37/268) in the group of imported VarV (chi2 = 1.92, P = 0.184) . The average duration of effective protection period for domestic and imported VarV was (6.2 +/- 2.7), (6.3 +/- 3.4) years (F = 2.24, P = 0.136)., CONCLUSIONS: The risk of varicella incidence and the proportion of fever or typical varicella zoster were lower in the one dose of VarV vaccinated; Effective protective effect was consistent in the children with domestic or imported VarV vaccination.

N2  - The outbreak of infectious diseases such as influenza, dengue fever, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are threatening the global health. Especially, developing countries in the South-East Asia region have been at serious risk. Rapid and highly reliable screening of infection is urgently needed during the epidemic season at mass gathering places, such as airport quarantine facilities, public health centers, and hospital outpatients units, etc. To meet this need, our research group is currently developing a multiple vital-signs based infection screening system that can perform human medical inspections within 15 seconds. This system remotely monitors facial temperature, heart and respiration rates using a thermopile array and a 24-GHz microwave radar, respectively. In this work, we redesigned our previous system to make a higher performance with a user-friendly interface. Moreover, the system newly included a multivariable logistic regression model (MLRM) to determine the possibility of infection. We tested the system on 34 seasonal influenza patients and 35 normal control subjects at the Japan Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital. The sensitivity and specificity of the screening system using the MLRM were 85.3% and 88.6%, respectively.

T1  - Considerations for recommending extended use and limited reuse of filtering facepiece respirators in health care settings
A1  - Fisher E.M.
A1  - Shaffer R.E. 
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Public health organizations, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are increasingly recommending the use of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) in health care settings. For infection control purposes, the usual practice is to discard FFRs after close contact with a patient ("single use"). However, in some situations, such as during contact with tuberculosis patients, limited FFR reuse (i.e., repeated donning and doffing of the same FFR by the same person) is practiced. A related practice, extended use, involves wearing the same FFR for multiple patient encounters without doffing. Extended use and limited FFR reuse have been recommended during infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics to conserve FFR supplies. This commentary examines CDC recommendations related to FFR extended use and limited reuse and analyzes available data from the literature to provide a relative estimate of the risks of these practices compared to single use. Analysis of the available data and the use of disease transmission models indicate that decisions regarding whether FFR extended use or reuse should be recommended should continue to be pathogen- and event-specific. Factors to be included in developing the recommendations are the potential for the pathogen to spread via contact transmission, the potential that the event could result in or is currently causing a FFR shortage, the protection provided by FFR use, human factors, potential for self-inoculation, the potential for secondary exposures, and government policies and regulations. While recent findings largely support the previous recommendations for extended use and limited reuse in certain situations, some new cautions and limitations should be considered before issuing recommendations in the future. In general, extended use of FFRs is preferred over limited FFR reuse. Limited FFR reuse would allow the user a brief respite from extended wear times, but increases the risk of self-inoculation and preliminary data from one study suggest that some FFR models may begin to lose effectiveness after multiple donnings.

N2  - The management of public health emergencies is improved by quick, exhaustive and standardized flow of data on disease outbreaks, by using specific tools for data collection, registration and analysis. In this context, the National Information System for the Notification of Outbreaks of Animal Diseases (SIMAN) has been developed in Italy to collect and share data on the notifications of outbreaks of animal diseases. SIMAN is connected through web services to the national database of animals and holdings (BDN) and has been integrated with tools for the management of epidemic emergencies. The website has been updated with a section dedicated to the contingency planning in case of epidemic emergency. EpiTrace is one such useful tool also integrated in the BDN and based on the Social Network Analysis (SNA) and on network epidemiological models. This tool gives the possibility of assessing the risk associated to holdings and animals on the basis of their trade, in order to support the veterinary services in tracing back and forward the animals in case of outbreaks of infectious diseases. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - A consensus plan for action to improve access to cancer care in the association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region
A1  - Woodward M. 
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - In many countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), cancer is an increasing problem due to ageing and a transition to Western lifestyles. Governments have been slow to react to the health consequences of these socioeconomic changes, leading to the risk of a cancer epidemic overwhelming the region. A major limitation to motivating change is the paucity of high-quality data on cancer, and its socioeconomic repercussions, in ASEAN. Two initiatives have been launched to address these issues. First, a study of over 9000 new cancer patients in ASEAN - the ACTION study - which records information on financial difficulties, as well as clinical outcomes, subsequent to the diagnosis. Second, a series of roundtable meetings of key stakeholders and experts, with the broad aim of producing advice for governments in ASEAN to take appropriate account of issues relating to cancer, as well as to generate knowledge and interest through engagement with the media. An important product of these roundtables has been the Jakarta Call to Action on Cancer Control. The growth and ageing of populations is a global challenge for cancer services. In the less developed parts of Asia, and elsewhere, these problems are compounded by the epidemiological transition to Western lifestyles and lack of awareness of cancer at the government level. For many years, health services in less developed countries have concentrated on infectious diseases and mother-and-child health; despite a recent wake-up call (United Nations, 2010), these health services have so far failed to allow for the huge increase in cancer cases to come. It has been estimated that, in Asia, the number of new cancer cases per year will grow from 6.1 million in 2008 to 10.6 million in 2030 (Sankaranarayanan et al., 2014). In the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), corresponding figures are 770 thousand in 2012 (Figure 1), rising to 1.3 million in 2030 (Ferlay et al., 2012). ASEAN consists of Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. It, thus, includes low- and middle-income countries where the double whammy of infectious and chronic diseases will pose an enormous challenge in allocating limited resources to competing health issues. Cancer statistics, even at the sub-national level, only tell part of the story. Many individuals who contract cancer in poor countries have no medical insurance and no, or limited, expectation of public assistance. Whilst any person who has a family member with cancer can expect to bear some consequential burden of care or expense, in a poor family in a poor environment the burden will surely be greater. This additional burden from cancer is rarely considered, and even more rarely quantified, even in developed nations.

T1  - A unifying theory for genetic epidemiological analysis of binary disease data
A1  - Lipschutz-Powell D.
A1  - Woolliams J.A.
A1  - Doeschl-Wilson A.B. 
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Genetic selection for host resistance offers a desirable complement to chemical treatment to control infectious disease in livestock. Quantitative genetics disease data frequently originate from field studies and are often binary. However, current methods to analyse binary disease data fail to take infection dynamics into account. Moreover, genetic analyses tend to focus on host susceptibility, ignoring potential variation in infectiousness, i.e. the ability of a host to transmit the infection. This stands in contrast to epidemiological studies, which reveal that variation in infectiousness plays an important role in the progression and severity of epidemics. In this study, we aim at filling this gap by deriving an expression for the probability of becoming infected that incorporates infection dynamics and is an explicit function of both host susceptibility and infectiousness. We then validate this expression according to epidemiological theory and by simulating epidemiological scenarios, and explore implications of integrating this expression into genetic analyses. Our simulations show that the derived expression is valid for a range of stochastic genetic-epidemiological scenarios. In the particular case of variation in susceptibility only, the expression can be incorporated into conventional quantitative genetic analyses using a complementary log-log link function (rather than probit or logit). Similarly, if there is moderate variation in both susceptibility and infectiousness, it is possible to use a logarithmic link function, combined with an indirect genetic effects model. However, in the presence of highly infectious individuals, i.e. super-spreaders, the use of any model that is linear in susceptibility and infectiousness causes biased estimates. Thus, in order to identify super-spreaders, novel analytical methods using our derived expression are required. We have derived a genetic-epidemiological function for quantitative genetic analyses of binary infectious disease data, which, unlike current approaches, takes infection dynamics into account and allows for variation in host susceptibility and infectiousness.

N2  - Keratitis, inflammation of the cornea, can result in partial or total loss of vision and can result from infectious agents (e.g., microbes including bacteria, fungi, amebae, and viruses) or from noninfectious causes (e.g., eye trauma, chemical exposure, and ultraviolet exposure). Contact lens wear is the major risk factor for microbial keratitis; outbreaks of Fusarium and Acanthamoeba keratitis have been associated with contact lens multipurpose solution use, and poor contact lens hygiene is a major risk factor for a spectrum of eye complications, including microbial keratitis and other contact lens-related inflammation. However, the overall burden and the epidemiology of keratitis in the United States have not been well described. To estimate the incidence and cost of keratitis, national ambulatory-care and emergency department databases were analyzed. The results of this analysis showed that an estimated 930,000 doctor's office and outpatient clinic visits and 58,000 emergency department visits for keratitis or contact lens disorders occur annually; 76.5% of keratitis visits result in antimicrobial prescriptions. Episodes of keratitis and contact lens disorders cost an estimated $175 million in direct health care expenditures, including $58 million for Medicare patients and $12 million for Medicaid patients each year. Office and outpatient clinic visits occupied over 250,000 hours of clinician time annually. Developing effective prevention messages that are disseminated to contact lens users and investigation of additional preventive efforts are important measures to reduce the national incidence of microbial keratitis.

N2  - Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) infection is a constant major threat to farmed and wild Atlantic salmon worldwide. Many epidemics have recently been reported in the most important salmon farming regions of the world, including Chile (2007-2009), where ISAV generated the most important disease and economic crisis in history of the salmon industry of the country. The spread of ISAV within a region is most likely by local or neighborhood spread from an infected farm; however, there is evidence that anthropogenic activities, such as movement of live or harvested fish or their byproduct, may have played a more important role than environmental or passive transmission in the 2007-2009 outbreak. Atlantic salmon farms (n=421) were retrospectively followed from stocking to harvesting in southern Chile at the time of the ISAV epidemic (2007-2009). The effect of husbandry and spatial risk factors, in addition to contact-network risk factors, which were obtained from the social network analyses, on time to first ISAV infection was estimated using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Five variables were retained in the final fitted model: co-existing multiple generations on a farm (hazard ratio [HR]=2.585), mean smolt weight at stocking greater than 120g (HR=1.165), farm area (perkm2) (HR=1.005), and increased number of shipments entering a farm, i.e. the farm input degree (HR=1.876) were associated with reduced time to infection; whereas time-to-infection was longer for farms located farther from an ongoing ISAV outbreak (HR=0.943). It was demonstrated that movements of latently infected fish resulted in approximately 7 outbreaks, and potentially explain about 6% of the total number of cases during the epidemic. Results from this study provide new information about the mechanisms of spread of ISAV in one the largest documented ISAV epidemics in the world. Findings may be used to support the design and implementation of risk-based surveillance and control programs that may help to prevent, detect and control future ISAV outbreaks. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - In Southeast Asia, traditional poultry marketing chains have been threatened by epidemics caused by the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (HPAI H5N1) virus. In Thailand, the trade of live backyard chickens is based on the activities of traders buying chickens from villages and supplying urban markets with chicken meat. This study aims to quantify the flows of chickens traded during a 1-year period in a province of Thailand. A compartmental stochastic dynamic model was constructed to illustrate trade flows of live chickens from villages to slaughterhouses. Live poultry movements present important temporal variations with increased activities during the 15 days preceding the Chinese New Year and, to a lesser extent, other festivals (Qingming Festival, Thai New Year, Hungry Ghost Festival, and International New Year). The average distance of poultry movements ranges from 4 to 25 km, defining a spatial scale for the risk of avian influenza that spread through traditional poultry marketing chains. Some characteristics of traditional poultry networks in Thailand, such as overlapping chicken supply zones, may facilitate disease diffusion over longer distances through combined expansion and relocation processes. This information may be of use in tailoring avian influenza and other emerging infectious poultry disease surveillance and control programs provided that the cost-effectiveness of such scenarios is also evaluated in further studies.

N2  - Aquaculture is anticipated to be a critical element in future solutions to global food shortage. However, diseases can impede industry efficiency and sustainability. Consequently, diseases can and have led to dramatic re-structuring in industry or regulatory practices. The emergence of infectious salmon anemia (ISA) in Chile is one such example. As in other countries, many mitigations were instituted universally, and many incurred considerable costs as they introduced a new layer of coordination of farming activities of marine sites within common geographic areas (termed 'neighborhoods' or 'barrios'). The aggregate response led to a strong reduction in ISA incidence and impact. However, the relative value of individual mitigations is less clear, especially where response policies were universally applied and retrospective analyses are missing 'controls' (i.e., areas where a mitigation was not applied). Further, re-focusing policies around disease prevention following resolution of an outbreak is important to renew sustainable production; though, again, field data to guide this shift in purpose are often lacking. Expert panels can offer timely decision support in the absence of empirical data. We convened a panel of fish health experts to weight risk factors predictive of ISA virus (ISAV) introduction or spread between Atlantic salmon barrios in Chile. Barrios, rather than sites, were the unit of interest because many of the new mitigations operate at this level and few available studies examine their efficacy. Panelists identified barrio processing plant biosecurity, fallowing strategies, adult live fish transfers, fish and site density, smolt quality, hydrographic connection with other neighborhoods, presence of sea lice (Caligus rogercresseyi), and harvest vessel biosecurity as factors with the greatest predictive strength for ISAV virulent genotype ('HPR-deleted') occurrence. Fewer factors were considered predictive of ISAV HPR0 genotype ('HPR0') occurrence, with greatest strengths assigned to fish and site density, adult live fish transfers, and smolt facility HPR0 status. Field validation based on ISAV and risk factor occurrence after panel completion generally supports expert estimates, and highlights a few factors (e.g., broodstock HPR0 status) less conclusive in the original study. Results inform legislation, industry best management practices and surveillance design. Copyright Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  - In 2011, ten years after the last reported outbreak, the eradication of rinderpest was declared. However, as rinderpest virus stocks still exist, there remains a risk of rinderpest re-introduction.A semi-quantitative risk assessment was conducted to assess this risk, which was defined as the probability of at least one host becoming infected and infectious outside a laboratory anywhere in the world within a one-year period. Pathways leading to rinderpest re-introduction were: deliberate or accidental use of virus in laboratories, deliberate or accidental use of vaccines, host exposure to an environmental source of virus, and use of virus for anti-animal biological warfare. The probability of each pathway step occurring was estimated through expert opinion elicitation.The risk estimate was associated with a high degree of uncertainty. It was estimated to range from negligible to high, with the median being very low. The accidental use of laboratory virus stocks was the highest risk pathway. Reducing the number of virus stocks and restricting their use, as well as upgrading the laboratories to a higher biosafety level, would effectively decrease the maximum and median risks. Likewise, ensuring that remaining vaccine stocks are not used and are instead destroyed or relocated to a limited number of regional repositories would also have a major effect on these estimates. However, these measures are unlikely to eliminate the risk of rinderpest re-introduction so that maintaining response preparedness is essential. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Xinxiang, a city in Henan Province, suffered from frequent floods due to persistent and heavy precipitation from 2004 to 2010. In the same period, dysentery was a common public health problem in Xinxiang, with the proportion of reported cases being the third highest among all the notified infectious diseases., OBJECTIVES: We focused on dysentery disease consequences of different degrees of floods and examined the association between floods and the morbidity of dysentery on the basis of longitudinal data during the study period., DESIGN: A time-series Poisson regression model was conducted to examine the relationship between 10 times different degrees of floods and the monthly morbidity of dysentery from 2004 to 2010 in Xinxiang. Relative risks (RRs) of moderate and severe floods on the morbidity of dysentery were calculated in this paper. In addition, we estimated the attributable contributions of moderate and severe floods to the morbidity of dysentery., RESULTS: A total of 7591 cases of dysentery were notified in Xinxiang during the study period. The effect of floods on dysentery was shown with a 0-month lag. Regression analysis showed that the risk of moderate and severe floods on the morbidity of dysentery was 1.55 (95% CI: 1.42-1.670) and 1.74 (95% CI: 1.56-1.94), respectively. The attributable risk proportions (ARPs) of moderate and severe floods to the morbidity of dysentery were 35.53 and 42.48%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that floods have significantly increased the risk of dysentery in the study area. In addition, severe floods have a higher proportional contribution to the morbidity of dysentery than moderate floods. Public health action should be taken to avoid and control a potential risk of dysentery epidemics after floods.

N2  - Many infectious agents transmitting through a contaminated environment are able to persist in the environment depending on the temperature and sanitation determined rates of their replication and clearance, respectively. There is a need to elucidate the effect of these factors on the infection transmission dynamics in terms of infection outbreaks and extinction while accounting for the random nature of the process. Also, it is important to distinguish between the true and apparent extinction, where the former means pathogen extinction in both the host and the environment while the latter means extinction only in the host population. This study proposes a stochastic-differential equation model as an approximation to a Markov jump process model, using Escherichia coli O157:H7 in cattle as a model system. In the model, the host population infection dynamics are described using the standard susceptible-infected-susceptible framework, and the E. coli O157:H7 population in the environment is represented by an additional variable. The backward Kolmogorov equations that determine the probability distribution and the expectation of the first passage time are provided in a general setting. The outbreak and apparent extinction of infection are investigated by numerically solving the Kolmogorov equations for the probability density function of the associated process and the expectation of the associated stopping time. The results provide insight into E. coli O157:H7 transmission and apparent extinction, and suggest ways for controlling the spread of infection in a cattle herd. Specifically, this study highlights the importance of ambient temperature and sanitation, especially during summer.

T1  - The importance of extended high viremics in models of HIV spread in South Africa
A1  - Armbruster B.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Recent studies found a substantial fraction of 'extended high viremics' among HIV-1 subtype C, the most common subtype in southern Africa. Extended high viremics are HIV infected individuals who maintain a high viral load for a longer time period than usual after the initial infection. They are more infectious during this period, and their infection progresses to full-blown AIDS and death much faster than usual. This study investigates the impact of extended high viremics on the spread of the HIV epidemic in South Africa. We develop a simple deterministic compartmental model for HIV infection that includes extended high viremics. As the available data on extended high viremics are limited, we parameterize this model using only the fraction of extended high viremics among new infections and the reduced life-span of extended high viremics. We find that without extended high viremics, the HIV prevalence in South Africa would have remained close to its 1990 level, instead of increasing to the current epidemic levels. We also find that the greater the fraction of extended high viremics among susceptibles, the greater the steady-state HIV prevalence and the more sensitive the steady-state prevalence is to the HIV transmission probability. These results suggest that extended high viremics have an impact on the HIV epidemic in South Africa; justify the need for comprehensive epidemiological studies since the current data is limited; and suggest that future models of HIV for southern Africa should explicitly model extended high viremics.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Mathematical models that couple disease dynamics and vaccinating behaviour often assume that the incentive to vaccinate disappears if disease prevalence is zero. Hence, they predict that vaccine refusal should be the rule, and elimination should be difficult or impossible. In reality, countries with non-mandatory vaccination policies have usually been able to maintain elimination or very low incidence of paediatric infectious diseases for long periods of time. Here, we show that including injunctive social norms can reconcile such behaviour-incidence models to observations. Adding social norms to a coupled behaviour-incidence model enables the model to better explain pertussis vaccine uptake and disease dynamics in the UK from 1967 to 2010, in both the vaccine-scare years and the years of high vaccine coverage. The model also illustrates how a vaccine scare can perpetuate suboptimal vaccine coverage long after perceived risk has returned to baseline, pre-vaccine-scare levels. However, at other model parameter values, social norms can perpetuate depressed vaccine coverage during a vaccine scare well beyond the time when the population's baseline vaccine risk perception returns to pre-scare levels. Social norms can strongly suppress vaccine uptake despite frequent outbreaks, as observed in some small communities. Significant portions of the parameter space also exhibit bistability, meaning long-term outcomes depend on the initial conditions. Depending on the context, social norms can either support or hinder immunization goals.

N2  - Infectious diseases can constitute public health emergencies of international concern when a pathogen arises, acquires new characteristics, or is deliberately released, leading to the potential for loss of human lives as well as societal disruption. A wide range of risk drivers are now known to lead to and/or exacerbate the emergence and spread of infectious disease, including global trade and travel, the overuse of antibiotics, intensive agriculture, climate change, high population densities, and inadequate infrastructures, such as water treatment facilities. Where multiple risk drivers interact, the potential impact of a disease outbreak is amplified. The varying temporal and geographic frequency with which infectious disease events occur adds yet another layer of complexity to the issue. Mitigating the emergence and spread of infectious disease necessitates mapping and prioritising the interdependencies between public health and other sectors. Conversely, during an international public health emergency, significant disruption occurs not only to healthcare systems but also to a potentially wide range of sectors, including trade, tourism, energy, civil protection, transport, agriculture, and so on. At the same time, dealing with a disease outbreak may require a range of critical sectors for support. There is a need to move beyond narrow models of risk to better account for the interdependencies between health and other sectors so as to be able to better mitigate and respond to the risks posed by emerging infectious disease.

T1  - Interhuman transmissibility of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Estimation of pandemic risk
A1  - Breban R.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Background The new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection shares many clinical, epidemiological, and virological similarities with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV. We aimed to estimate virus transmissibility and the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV, and to compare the results with similar findings obtained for prepandemic SARS. Methods We retrieved data for MERS-CoV clusters from the WHO summary and subsequent reports, and published descriptions of cases, and took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported as of June 21, 2013, excluding cases notified in the previous 2 weeks. To assess the interhuman transmissibility of MERS-CoV, we used Bayesian analysis to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) and compared it to that of prepandemic SARS. We considered two scenarios, depending on the interpretation of the MERS-CoV cluster-size data. Results With our most pessimistic scenario (scenario 2), we estimated MERS-CoV R0 to be 0.69 (95% CI 0.50- 0.92); by contrast, the R0 for prepandemic SARS-CoV was 0.80 (0.54-1.13). Our optimistic scenario (scenario 1) yielded a MERS-CoV R0 of 0.60 (0.42-0.80). Because of recent implementation of effective contact tracing and isolation procedures, further MERS-CoV transmission data might no longer describe an entire cluster, but only secondary infections directly caused by the index patient. Hence, we calculated that, under scenario 2, eight or more secondary infections caused by the next index patient would translate into a 5% or higher chance that the revised MERS-CoV R0 would exceed 1 - ie, that MERS-CoV might have pandemic potential. Interpretation Our analysis suggests that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential. We recommend enhanced surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the MERS-CoV animal hosts and transmission routes to human beings.

T1  - Sunlight vitamin D and skin cancer
A1  - Mason R.S.
A1  - Reichrath J. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Today, there is a controversial debate in many scientific and public communities on how much sunlight is appropriate to balance between the positive and negative effects of solar UV-exposure. UV exposure undoubtedly causes DNA damage of skin cells and is a major environmental risk factor for all types of skin cancers. In geographic terms, living in parts of the world with increased erythemal UV or high average annual bright sun results in increased risks of skin cancers, with the greatest increased risk for squamous cell carcinoma, followed by basal cell carcinoma and then melanoma. On the other hand, sunlight exerts positive effects on human health, that are mediated in part via UV-B-mediated cutaneous photosynthesis of vitamin D. It has been estimated that at present, approximately 1 billion people worldwide are vitamin D-deficient or -insufficient. This epidemic causes serious health problems that are still widely under-recognized. Vitamin D deficiency leads to well documented problems for bone and muscle function. There are also associations between vitamin D-deficiency and increased incidence of and/or unfavourable outcome for a broad variety of independent diseases, including various types of malignancies (e.g. colon-, skin-, and breast cancer), autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. In this review, the present literature is analyzed to summarize our present knowledge about the important relationship of sunlight, vitamin D and skin cancer. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

T1  - The Impact of Model Building on the Transmission Dynamics under Vaccination: Observable (Symptom-Based) versus Unobservable (Contagiousness-Dependent) Approaches
A1  - Ejima K.
A1  - Aihara K.
A1  - Nishiura H. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Background: The way we formulate a mathematical model of an infectious disease to capture symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission can greatly influence the likely effectiveness of vaccination in the presence of vaccine effect for preventing clinical illness. The present study aims to assess the impact of model building strategy on the epidemic threshold under vaccination. Methodology/Principal Findings: We consider two different types of mathematical models, one based on observable variables including symptom onset and recovery from clinical illness (hereafter, the "observable model") and the other based on unobservable information of infection event and infectiousness (the "unobservable model"). By imposing a number of modifying assumptions to the observable model, we let it mimic the unobservable model, identifying that the two models are fully consistent only when the incubation period is identical to the latent period and when there is no pre-symptomatic transmission. We also computed the reproduction numbers with and without vaccination, demonstrating that the data generating process of vaccine-induced reduction in symptomatic illness is consistent with the observable model only and examining how the effective reproduction number is differently calculated by two models. Conclusion(s): To explicitly incorporate the vaccine effect in reducing the risk of symptomatic illness into the model, it is fruitful to employ a model that directly accounts for disease progression. More modeling studies based on observable epidemiological information are called for. © 2013 Ejima et al.

N2  - Background. Few researchers have assessed the relationships between socioeconomic inequality and infectious disease outbreaks at the population level globally. We use a socioeconomic model to forecast national annual rates of infectious disease outbreaks.Methods. We constructed a multivariate mixed-effects Poisson model of the number of times a given country was the origin of an outbreak in a given year. The dataset included 389 outbreaks of international concern reported in the World Health Organization's Disease Outbreak News from 1996 to 2008. The initial full model included 9 socioeconomic variables related to education, poverty, population health, urbanization, health infrastructure, gender equality, communication, transportation, and democracy, and 1 composite index. Population, latitude, and elevation were included as potential confounders. The initial model was pared down to a final model by a backwards elimination procedure. The dependent and independent variables were lagged by 2 years to allow for forecasting future rates.Results. Among the socioeconomic variables tested, the final model included child measles immunization rate and telephone line density. The Democratic Republic of Congo, China, and Brazil were predicted to be at the highest risk for outbreaks in 2010, and Colombia and Indonesia were predicted to have the highest percentage of increase in their risk compared to their average over 1996-2008. Conclusions. Understanding socioeconomic factors could help improve the understanding of outbreak risk. The inclusion of the measles immunization variable suggests that there is a fundamental basis in ensuring adequate public health capacity. Increased vigilance and expanding public health capacity should be prioritized in the projected high-risk regions. © 2012 The Author 2012.

T1  - Epidemiology in multiple sclerosis: a pilgrim's progress
A1  - Kurtzke J.F. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - There was more neurology taught under Harold G. Wolff at Cornell University Medical College in New York than perhaps anywhere else in the country when I attended from 1948 to 1952. I took my residency at the Veterans Administration Hospital in the Bronx, New York, a teaching hospital of Cornell, with Wolff as my Director of Training. While a resident, we thought we had found a treatment for multiple sclerosis. To test our conclusion, the first Class 1 treatment trial ever conducted for multiple sclerosis was performed. This showed no effect, but the participants began investigating multiple sclerosis among the 16 million persons at prime age for symptom onset who had served in the military in World War II. This led me to study its epidemiology worldwide, beginning with a detailed review of all published population-based estimates of frequency. Among these were nationwide surveys from Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and later Norway and Finland, which showed in each country a concentration of the significantly high regions into contiguous areas forming a single 'focus' in each land, maximal in Denmark under the age of 15 years. The primary locus of high frequency multiple sclerosis seemed to be in the south-central inland lake region of Sweden, with spread to its contiguous neighbours. These concentrations in time and space indicated that multiple sclerosis was a disease probably acquired in early adolescence. Migration studies supported this: moves from high to low showed retention of birthplace risk only for those aged >15 years, whereas opposite moves indicated susceptibility limited to some 11-45 year olds. Epidemics of multiple sclerosis would suggest the disease is not only acquired but also infectious. If an infectious origin were true, transmission would have to occur before clinical onset, and would have to involve a much greater number of subjects than clinically involved. I believe there have been epidemics in Iceland, Shetland-Orkney and the Faroe Islands. On the Faroes there were no cases of multiple sclerosis among native-born resident Faroese from 1900 until 1943, when the first of 21 cases had clinical onset, heralding a type 1 epidemic with peak incidence rates >10 per 100 000 for 1945-46. British troops who occupied the islands from April 1940 to September 1945 we believe brought a widespread (because of the scatter of Faroese cases), asymptomatic (because they were healthy troops), persistent infection we called the primary multiple sclerosis affection that involved a large proportion of Faroese, with clinical multiple sclerosis ensuing in a very small proportion. Primary multiple sclerosis affection itself may have been manifest there as a newly introduced cause of acute infectious gastroenteritis and is possibly the underlying cause of multiple sclerosis in general. © 2013 The Author (2013).

N2  - BACKGROUND: During the 2009 outbreak of novel influenza AH1N1, insufficient data were available to adequately inform decision makers about benefits and risks of vaccination and disease. We hypothesized that individuals would opt to mimic their peers, having no better decision anchor. We used Game Theory, decision analysis, and transmission models to simulate the impact of subjective risks and preference estimates on vaccination behavior., METHODS: We asked 95 students to provide estimates of risk and health state valuations with regard to AH1N1 infection, complications, and expectations of vaccine benefits and risks. These estimates were included in a sequential chain of models: a dynamic epidemic model, a decision tree, and a population-level model. Additionally, participants' intentions to vaccinate or not at varying vaccination rates were documented., RESULTS: The model showed that at low vaccination rates, vaccination dominated. When vaccination rates increased above 78%, nonvaccination was the dominant strategy. We found that vaccination intentions did not correspond to the shift in strategy dominance and segregated to 3 types of intentions: regardless of what others do 29/95 (31%) intended to vaccinate while 27/95 (28%) did not; among 39 of 95 (41%) intention was positively associated with putative vaccination rates., CONCLUSIONS: Some people conform to the majority's choice, either shifting epidemic dynamics toward herd immunity or, conversely, limiting societal goals. Policy leaders should use models carefully, noting their limitations and theoretical assumptions. Behavior drivers were not explicitly explored in this study, and the discrepant results beg further investigation. Models including real subjective perceptions with empiric or subjective probabilities can provide insight into deviations from expected rational behavior and suggest interventions in order to provide better population outcomes.

N2  - Models of infectious disease spread that incorporate contact heterogeneity through contact networks are an important tool for epidemiologists studying disease dynamics and assessing intervention strategies. One of the challenges of contact network epidemiology has been the difficulty of collecting individual and population-level data needed to develop an accurate representation of the underlying host population's contact structure. In this study, we evaluate the utility of common epidemiological measures (R0, epidemic peak size, duration and final size) for inferring the degree of heterogeneity in a population's unobserved contact structure through a Bayesian approach. We test the method using ground truth data and find that some of these epidemiological metrics are effective at classifying contact heterogeneity. The classification is also consistent across pathogen transmission probabilities, and so can be applied even when this characteristic is unknown. In particular, the reproductive number, R0, turns out to be a poor classifier of the degree heterogeneity, while, unexpectedly, final epidemic size is a powerful predictor of network structure across the range of heterogeneity. We also evaluate our framework on empirical epidemiological data from past and recent outbreaks to demonstrate its application in practice and to gather insights about the relevance of particular contact structures for both specific systems and general classes of infectious disease. We thus introduce a simple approach that can shed light on the unobserved connectivity of a host population given epidemic data. Our study has the potential to inform future data-collection efforts and study design by driving our understanding of germane epidemic measures, and highlights a general inferential approach to learning about host contact structure in contemporary or historic populations of humans and animals. © 2012 The Authors.

N2  - An efficient surveillance system is a crucial factor in identifying, monitoring and tackling outbreaks of infectious diseases. Scarcity of data and limited amounts of economic resources require a targeted effort from public health authorities. In this paper, we propose a mathematical method to identify areas where surveillance is critical and low reporting rates might leave epidemics undetected. Our approach combines the use of reference-based susceptible-exposed-infectious models and observed reporting data;We propose two different specifications, for constant and time-varying surveillance, respectively. Our case study is centred around the spread of the raccoon rabies epidemic in the state of New York, using data collected between 1990 and 2007. Both methods offer a feasible solution to analyse and identify areas of intervention. © 2013 The Author(s).

N2  - Observations on infectious diseases often consist of a sample of cases, distinguished by symptoms, and other characteristics, such as onset dates, spatial locations, genetic sequence of the pathogen and/or physiological and clinical data. Cases are often clustered, in space and time, suggesting that they are connected. By defining kernel functions for pairwise analysis of cases, a matrix of transmission probabilities can be estimated.We set up a Bayesian framework to integrate various sources of information to estimate the transmission network. The method is illustrated by analysing data from a multi-year study (2002-2007) of nosocomial outbreaks of norovirus in a large university hospital in the Netherlands. The study included 264 cases, the norovirus genotype was known in approximately 60 per cent of the patients. Combining all the available data allowed likely identification of individual transmission links between most of the cases (72%). This illustrates that the proposed method can be used to accurately reconstruct transmission networks, enhancing our understanding of outbreak dynamics and possibly leading to new insights into how to prevent outbreaks. © 2013 The Authors.

N2  - Multiple outbreaks of human norovirus (hNoV) have been associated with fresh produce, such as soft berries and lettuce. Even though food handlers are considered an important source for the introduction of hNoV into food chains, their contribution to public health risks associated with hNoV remains unknown. To assess to which extent food handlers contribute to the introduction and spread of hNoV in fresh produce chains quantitative virus transfer data are needed. We estimated transfer proportions of hNoV GI.4, GII.4, murine norovirus (MNV-1), a culturable surrogate of hNoV, and human adenovirus (hAdV-2), a human pathogen proposed as an indicator for human faecal pollution, between gloved fingertips and raspberries, strawberries, and lettuce, by quantitative RT-PCR and cell culture if applicable. Virus transfer proportions were corrected for virus-matrix specific recoveries, and variability and uncertainty of the parameters were estimated. Virus transfer from gloves to soft berries was generally lower as compared to lettuce, with mean transfer proportions ranging between 0.1 to 2.3% and 9 to 10% for infectious MNV-1 and hAdV-2, respectively. Transfer from produce to glove was mostly greater than transfer from glove to produce, adding to the likelihood of virus transfer due to cross contamination from contaminated produce via food handlers. HNoV GI.4 and hNoV GII.4 showed no significant difference between their mean transfer proportions. Using the estimated transfer proportions, we studied the impact of low and high transfer proportions on the public health risk, based on a scenario in which a food handler picked raspberries with contaminated fingertips. Given the made assumptions, we could show that for a pathogen as infectious as hNoV, low transfer proportions may pose a greater public health risk than high transfer proportions, due to a greater viral spread. We demonstrated the potential of food handlers in spreading hNoV in food chains, showing that prevention of virus contamination on food handlers' hands is crucial for food safety. Nevertheless, complete prevention of virus contamination on fresh produce cannot be achieved in reality, and reliable and effective intervention measures are consequently required. We estimated that, especially for low transfer proportions, a robust one log10-unit reduction of infectious hNoV on contaminated produce, and on food handlers' hands, could lower the public health risk substantially. Using the obtained data in quantitative risk assessment will aid in elucidating the contribution of food handlers in hNoV transmission. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The consumption of fresh produce is frequently associated with outbreaks of human norovirus (hNoV) disease. To prevent the contamination of fresh produce with hNoV, knowledge of the possible introduction sources of the viruses, such as water, is needed to be able to implement appropriate and efficient preventive measures. Contaminated water used to reconstitute pesticides could be a relevant source of infectious hNoV, determined by the initial level of virus contamination and the persistence of these viruses in reconstituted pesticides. We studied the persistence of hNoV GI.4, hNoV GII.4 and murine norovirus (MNV-1), the only culturable norovirus, in eight different pesticides after 0 and 2. h. Virus concentrations were determined by reverse transcriptase PCR, and infectivity of MNV-1 was determined by endpoint dilutions followed by maximum likelihood estimations.MNV-1 was found to remain infectious in seven of the eight tested pesticides at the highest concentration applied in practice. In the presence of the insecticide Vertimec, MNV-1 infectivity decreased rapidly with a 1.9 log10-unit reduction at timepoint T0. Also, the concentration of NoV GI.4 RNA decreased considerably with a 1.7 log10-unit reduction; whereas the detected PCR fragment of hNoV GII.4 remained stable.Assuming a similar persistence of infectious MNV-1 and hNoV we can conclude that water containing hNoV used to dilute pesticides may be an important source of infectious hNoV in fresh produce chains. The application of pesticides may therefore not only be a chemical hazard, but also a microbiological hazard for public health. The inclusion of antiviral substances in reconstituted pesticides may be appropriate to reduce the virological health risk posed by the application of pesticides. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Human brucellosis incidence in China has been increasing dramatically since 1999. However, epidemiological features and potential factors underlying the re-emergence of the disease remain less understood. Method(s): Data on human and animal brucellosis cases at the county scale were collected for the year 2004 to 2010. Also collected were environmental and socioeconomic variables. Epidemiological features including spatial and temporal patterns of the disease were characterized, and the potential factors related to the spatial heterogeneity and the temporal trend of were analysed using Poisson regression analysis, Granger causality analysis, and autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) models, respectively. Result(s): The epidemic showed a significantly higher spatial correlation with the number of sheep and goats than swine and cattle. The disease was most prevalent in grassland areas with elevation between 800-1,600 meters. The ADL models revealed that local epidemics were correlated with comparatively lower temperatures and less sunshine in winter and spring, with a 1-7 month lag before the epidemic peak in May. Conclusion(s): Our findings indicate that human brucellosis tended to occur most commonly in grasslands at moderate elevation where sheep and goats were the predominant livestock, and in years with cooler winter and spring or less sunshine. © 2013 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

T1  - A low-cost method to assess the epidemiological importance of individuals in controlling infectious disease outbreaks
A1  - Smieszek T.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Background: Infectious disease outbreaks in communities can be controlled by early detection and effective prevention measures. Assessing the relative importance of each individual community member with respect to these two processes requires detailed knowledge about the underlying social contact network on which the disease can spread. However, mapping social contact networks is typically too resource-intensive to be a practical possibility for most communities and institutions. Method(s): Here, we describe a simple, low-cost method - called collocation ranking - to assess individual importance for early detection and targeted intervention strategies that are easily implementable in practice. The method is based on knowledge about individual collocation which is readily available in many community settings such as schools, offices, hospitals, and so on. We computationally validate our method in a school setting by comparing the outcome of the method against computational predictions based on outbreak simulations on an empirical high-resolution contact network. We compare collocation ranking to other methods for assessing the epidemiological importance of the members of a population. To this end, we select subpopulations of the school population by applying these assessment methods to the population and adding individuals to the subpopulation according to their individual rank. Then, we assess how suited these subpopulations are for early detection and targeted intervention strategies. Result(s): Likelihood and timing of infection during an outbreak are important features for early detection and targeted intervention strategies. Subpopulations selected by the collocation ranking method show a substantially higher average infection probability and an earlier onset of symptoms than randomly selected subpopulations. Furthermore, these subpopulations selected by the collocation ranking method were close to the optimum. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that collocation ranking is a highly effective method to assess individual importance, providing critical low-cost information for the development of sentinel surveillance systems and prevention strategies. © 2013 Smieszek and Salathe; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Polio eradication is on the cusp of success, with only a few regions still maintaining transmission. Improving our understanding of why some regions have been successful and others have not will help with both global eradication of polio and development of more effective vaccination strategies for other pathogens. To examine the past 25 years of eradication efforts, we constructed a transmission model for wild poliovirus that incorporates waning immunity (which affects both infection risk and transmissibility of any resulting infection), age-mediated vaccination rates, and transmission of oral polio vaccine. The model produces results consistent with the 4 country categories defined by the Global Polio Eradication Program: elimination with no subsequent outbreaks; elimination with subsequent transient outbreaks; elimination with subsequent outbreaks and transmission detected for more than 12 months; and endemic polio transmission. Analysis of waning immunity rates and oral polio vaccine transmissibility reveals that higher waning immunity rates make eradication more difficult because of increasing numbers of infectious adults, and that higher oral polio vaccine transmission rates make eradication easier as adults become reimmunized. Given these dynamic properties, attention should be given to intervention strategies that complement childhood vaccination. For example, improvement in sanitation can reduce the reproduction number in problematic regions, and adult vaccination can lower adult transmission. © 2013 © The Author 2013.

N2  - Background: From 2008 to the end of 2011, Europe experienced a major outbreak of measles. The outbreak hit France especially hard, with measles hotspots in the South-East of France. It is known that people living in precarious socio-economic conditions are more exposed to infectious diseases. Regarding the local situation, the NGO "MdM-Marseille" decided to conduct a vaccination campaign among the Roma community living in camps. Method(s): The campaign was planned with two injections of a combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) in a one month interval for all young people born since 1980 and over the age of one year, regardless of antecedents. Twenty-four camps were selected. The target population was estimated at 720 people. Each site was the subject of an information visit. A letter was sent to the Prefecture to inform them and ask for a moratorium on evictions for the identified camps. Result(s): Between May 15th and September 15th 2011, 326 primary immunizations were performed during 34 visits (covering 45.3% of the target population). Over the same period, almost all the camps were evacuated, forcing teams to stop the vaccination campaign. The second injection campaign covered only 37 persons. Conclusion(s): The vaccination campaign among Roma populations in Marseilles was organized in a context of a major national outbreak of measles in the general population. Although the Prefecture was informed, camp evictions were not interrupted. This highlights the discrepancy between public health policy and security policy. In the context of an epidemic, innovative actions should be focused on vulnerable populations in partnership with health authorities. The main objective is to find procedures that can protect populations at risk in the event of a health crisis but which are also useful for routine prevention. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - Surveillance is a critical component of disease control programmes but is often poorly resourced, particularly in developing countries lacking good infrastructure and especially for zoonoses which require combined veterinary and medical capacity and collaboration. Here we examine how successful control, and ultimately disease elimination, depends on effective surveillance. We estimated that detection probabilities of <0.1 are broadly typical of rabies surveillance in endemic countries and areas without a history of rabies. Using outbreak simulation techniques we investigated how the probability of detection affects outbreak spread, and outcomes of response strategies such as time to control an outbreak, probability of elimination, and the certainty of declaring freedom from disease. Assuming realistically poor surveillance (probability of detection <0.1), we show that proactive mass dog vaccination is much more effective at controlling rabies and no more costly than campaigns that vaccinate in response to case detection. Control through proactive vaccination followed by 2 years of continuous monitoring and vaccination should be sufficient to guarantee elimination from an isolated area not subject to repeat introductions. We recommend that rabies control programmes ought to be able to maintain surveillance levels that detect at least 5% (and ideally 10%) of all cases to improve their prospects of eliminating rabies, and this can be achieved through greater intersectoral collaboration. Our approach illustrates how surveillance is critical for the control and elimination of diseases such as canine rabies and can provide minimum surveillance requirements and technical guidance for elimination programmes under a broad-range of circumstances. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Incubation period for campylobacteriosis and its importance in the estimation of incidence related to travel
A1  - Horn B.J.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Differentiation between travel-related and domestic cases of infectious disease is important in managing risk. Incubation periods of cases from several outbreaks of campylobacteriosis in Canada, Europe, and the United States with defined exposure time of less than 24 hours were collated to provide information on the incubation period distribution. This distribution was consistent across the varied outbreaks considered, with 84% (702/832) of cases having an incubation period of four days or less and 1% having an incubation period of eight days or more. The incubation period distribution was incorporated into a model for the number of travel-related cases presenting with symptom onset at given dates after return to their country of residence. Using New Zealand notification data between 2006 and 2010 for cases who had undertaken foreign travel within 10 days prior to symptom onset, we found that 29.6% (67/227 cases; 95% confidence interval (CI): 28.3-30.8%) of these cases were likely to have been domestic cases. When cases with symptom onset prior to arrival were included, the probable domestic cases represented 11.8% (67/571; 95% CI: 11.2-12.3%). Consideration of incubation time distributions and consistent collection of travel start/end dates with symptom onset dates would assist attribution of cases to foreign travel. ©2007-2013.

N2  - Background A timely risk assessment is desired to guide decisions on preventive transfusion safety measures during emerging infectious disease (EID) outbreaks. The European Up-Front Risk Assessment Tool (EUFRAT) model was developed to provide quantitative transmission risk estimates of EIDs through blood transfusion. Study Design and Methods The generic model comprises five sequential steps to estimate the infection risks in the blood transfusion chain: 1) the prevalence of infection in the donor population, 2) the risk of obtaining infected donations, 3) infected components, 4) infected blood products, and 5) the risk of transmitting the infection to recipients. The model uses inputs from epidemiologic characteristics of an EID and transfusion practice. The model was applied to data from a recent chikungunya outbreak in Italy. Results Based on data from the outbreak peak, an estimated prevalence of 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-2.03) per 100,000 donors would lead to 0.04 infected donations (95% CI, 0.01-0.10), 0.13 infected blood components, 0.13 infected end products, and 0.0001 severe infections in recipients. This estimated risk can be reduced by increasing the duration of quarantine of the donated blood and becomes zero after 7 or more days of quarantine. The model also estimated the probability of a donor returning from the outbreak area and subsequently donating infected blood in his home country to be 0.30 (95% CI, 0.01-0.65) per 100,000. Conclusion The model can be used to quantify EID outbreak risks to blood transfusion recipients and the effect of targeted safety interventions and as such support public health decision-making. © 2012 American Association of Blood Banks.

N2  - Background. Reliable methods for estimating the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are needed to monitor the epidemic, identify at-risk populations, and evaluate HIV prevention strategies. We used a multifaceted approach to estimate HIV incidence in the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 064 study.Methods. The HPTN 064 study enrolled 2067 HIV-seronegative women and 32 HIV-seropositive women with no prior HIV infection diagnosis. Women were followed for up to 12 months. HIV incidence estimates were based on (1) detection of acute HIV infection, (2) documentation of HIV seroconversion, and (3) detection of recent HIV infection, using a multiassay algorithm (MAA).Results. Two women had acute HIV infection at enrollment, 4 seroconverted, and 2 were identified as recently infected at enrollment using the MAA. The annual HIV incidence estimate based on acute infection at enrollment (2.52% [95% confidence interval {CI},. 17%-9.33%], using a 14-day window period) was higher than the estimate based on seroconversion (0.24% [95% CI,. 07%-.62%]; P =. 027). Incidence estimates obtained using the MAA at enrollment and at the end of study were 0.25% (95% CI,. 03%-.93%) and 0.13% (95% CI,. 006%-.76%), respectively.Conclusions. We detected a high frequency of acute infection at enrollment. Cross-sectional HIV incidence estimates obtained using the MAA were similar to the longitudinal estimate based on HIV seroconversion. © The Author 2012.

N2  - Several haemorrhagic fevers are caused by highly pathogenic viruses that must be handled in Biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) containment. These zoonotic infections have an important impact on public health and the development of a rapid and differential diagnosis in case of outbreak in risk areas represents a critical priority. We have demonstrated the potential of a DNA resequencing microarray (PathogenID v2.0) for this purpose. The microarray was first validated in vitro using supernatants of cells infected with prototype strains from five different families of BSL-4 viruses (e.g. families Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae and Paramyxoviridae). RNA was amplified based on isothermal amplification by Phi29 polymerase before hybridization. We were able to detect and characterize Nipah virus and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in the brains of experimentally infected animals. CCHFV was finally used as a paradigm for epidemics because of recent outbreaks in Turkey, Kosovo and Iran. Viral variants present in human sera were characterized by BLASTN analysis. Sensitivity was estimated to be 105-106 PFU/mL of hybridized cDNA. Detection specificity was limited to viral sequences having ~13-14% of global divergence with the tiled sequence, or stretches of ~20 identical nucleotides. These results highlight the benefits of using the PathogenID v2.0 resequencing microarray to characterize geographical variants in the follow-up of haemorrhagic fever epidemics; to manage patients and protect communities; and in cases of bioterrorism. © 2012 The Authors.

N2  - Severe flooding, which is associated with numerous outbreaks of a wide range of infectious diseases, particularly those caused by enteric viruses, occurred in all areas of Thailand in 2011. To determine the prevalence of five human enteric viruses, namely enterovirus, rotavirus (RV), norovirus (NV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), and hepatitis E virus, in the flood water, 100 water samples were collected from flood-damaged areas in central Thailand. Viral RNA was extracted from concentrated samples and analyzed by RT-PCR and sequencing. NV was the most commonly detected pathogen in the tested samples (14%). RV and HAV were detected in 9% and 7% of samples, respectively. This study is the first to detect enteric viral genes in flood water in Thailand. Furthermore, it is the first to detect an NV gene in any type of environmental water in Thailand. These results provide useful information for estimating the risk of flood waterborne viral infection.

N2  - Classical approaches to estimate vaccine efficacy are based on the assumption that a person's risk of infection does not depend on the infection status of others. This assumption is untenable for infectious disease data where such dependencies abound. We present a novel approach to estimating vaccine efficacy in a Bayesian framework using disease transmission models. The methodology is applied to outbreaks of mumps in primary schools in the Netherlands. The total study population consisted of 2,493 children in ten primary schools, of which 510 (20%) were known to have been infected, and 832 (33%) had unknown infection status. The apparent vaccination coverage ranged from 12% to 93%, and the apparent infection attack rate varied from 1% to 76%. Our analyses show that vaccination reduces the probability of infection per contact substantially but not perfectly (VEs = 0.933; 95CrI: 0.908-0.954). Mumps virus appears to be moderately transmissible in the school setting, with each case yielding an estimated 2.5 secondary cases in an unvaccinated population (R0 = 2.49; 95%CrI: 2.36-2.63), resulting in moderate estimates of the critical vaccination coverage (64.2%; 95%CrI: 61.7-66.7%). The indirect benefits of vaccination are highest in populations with vaccination coverage just below the critical vaccination coverage. In these populations, it is estimated that almost two infections can be prevented per vaccination. We discuss the implications for the optimal control of mumps in heterogeneously vaccinated populations. © 2013 van Boven et al.

N2  - Background. There is evidence to suggest that antiretroviral therapy (ART) and testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reduce the probability of transmission of HIV. This has led health officials across the United States to take steps toward a test-and-treat policy. However, the extent of the benefits generated by test-and-treat is debatable, and there are concerns, such as increased multidrug resistance (MDR), that remain unaddressed.Methods. We developed a deterministic epidemiologic model to simulate the HIV/AIDS epidemic for men who have sex with men (MSM) in Los Angeles County (LAC). We calibrated the model to match the HIV surveillance data from LAC across a 10-year period, starting in 2000. We then modified our model to simulate the test-and-treat policy and compared epidemiologic outcomes under the test-and-treat scenario to the status quo scenario over the years 2012-2023. Outcome measures included new infections, deaths, new AIDS cases, and MDR.Results. Relative to the status quo, the test-and-treat model resulted in a 34% reduction in new infections, 19% reduction in deaths, and 39% reduction in new AIDS cases by 2023. However, these results are counterbalanced by a near doubling of the prevalence of MDR (9.06% compared to 4.79%) in 2023. We also found that the effects of increasing testing and treatment were not complementary.Conclusions. Although test-and-treat generates substantial benefits, it will not eliminate the epidemic for MSM in LAC. Moreover, these benefits are counterbalanced by large increases in MDR. © The Author 2013.

T1  - Estimating the Probability of a Major Outbreak from the Timing of Early Cases: An Indeterminate Problem?

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Conservation biologists, as well as veterinary and public health officials, would benefit greatly from being able to forecast whether outbreaks of infectious disease will be major. For values of the basic reproductive number (R0) between one and two, infectious disease outbreaks have a reasonable chance of either fading out at an early stage or, in the absence of intervention, spreading widely within the population. If it were possible to predict when fadeout was likely to occur, the need for costly precautionary control strategies could be minimized. However, the predictability of even simple epidemic processes remains largely unexplored. Here we conduct an examination of simulated data from the early stages of a fatal disease outbreak and explore how observable information might be useful for predicting major outbreaks. Specifically, would knowing the time of deaths for the first few cases allow us to predict whether an outbreak will be major? Using two approaches, trajectory matching and discriminant function analysis, we find that even in our best-case scenario (with accurate knowledge of epidemiological parameters, and precise times of death), it was not possible to reliably predict the outcome of a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) process. © 2013 Craft et al.

N2  - We examined the spatial distribution pattern and meteorological drivers of dengue fever (DF) in Guangdong Province, China. Annual incidence of DF was calculated for each county between 2005 and 2011 and the geographical distribution pattern of DF was examined using Moran's I statistic and excess risk maps. A time-stratified case-crossover study was used to investigate the short-term relationship between DF and meteorological factors and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). High-epidemic DF areas were restricted to the Pearl River Delta region and the Han River Delta region, Moran's I of DF distribution was significant from 2005 to 2006 and from 2009 to 2011. Daily vapour pressure, mean and minimum temperatures were associated with increased DF risk. Maximum temperature and SOI were negatively associated with DF transmission. The risk of DF was non-randomly distributed in the counties in Guangdong Province. Meteorological factors could be important predictors of DF transmission.Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2013.

T1  - The pandemic potential of Nipah virus
A1  - Luby S.P. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Nipah virus, a paramyxovirus whose wildlife reservoir is Pteropus bats, was first discovered in a large outbreak of acute encephalitis in Malaysia in 1998 among persons who had contact with sick pigs. Apparently, one or more pigs was infected from bats, and the virus then spread efficiently from pig to pig, then from pigs to people. Nipah virus outbreaks have been recognized nearly every year in Bangladesh since 2001 and occasionally in neighboring India. Outbreaks in Bangladesh and India have been characterized by frequent person-to-person transmission and the death of over 70% of infected people. Characteristics of Nipah virus that increase its risk of becoming a global pandemic include: humans are already susceptible; many strains are capable of limited person-to-person transmission; as an RNA virus, it has an exceptionally high rate of mutation: and that if a human-adapted strain were to infect communities in South Asia, high population densities and global interconnectedness would rapidly spread the infection. Appropriate steps to estimate and manage this risk include studies to explore the molecular and genetic basis of respiratory transmission of henipaviruses, improved surveillance for human infections, support from high-income countries to reduce the risk of person-to-person transmission of infectious agents in low-income health care settings, and consideration of vaccination in communities at ongoing risk of exposure to the secretions and excretions of Pteropus bats. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - The effects of host diversity on vector-borne disease: The conditions under which diversity will amplify or dilute the disease risk
A1  - Miller E.
A1  - Huppert A. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Multihost vector-borne infectious diseases form a significant fraction of the global infectious disease burden. In this study we explore the relationship between host diversity, vector behavior, and disease risk. To this end, we have developed a new dynamic model which includes two distinct host species and one vector species with variable preferences. With the aid of the model we were able to compute the basic reproductive rate, R0, a well-established measure of disease risk that serves as a threshold parameter for disease outbreak. The model analysis reveals that the system has two different qualitative behaviors: (i) the well-known dilution effect, where the maximal R0 is obtained in a community which consists a single host (ii) a new amplification effect, denoted by us as diversity amplification, where the maximal R0 is attained in a community which consists both hosts. The model analysis extends on previous results by underlining the mechanism of both, diversity amplification and the dilution, and specifies the exact conditions for their occurrence. We have found that diversity amplification occurs where the vector prefers the host with the highest transmission ability, and dilution is obtained when the vector does not show any preference, or it prefers to bite the host with the lower transmission ability. The mechanisms of dilution and diversity amplification are able to account for the different and contradictory patterns often observed in nature (i.e., in some cases disease risk is increased while in other is decreased when the diversity is increased). Implication of the diversity amplification mechanism also challenges current premises about the interaction between biodiversity, climate change, and disease risk and calls for retrospective thinking in planning intervention policies aimed at protecting the preferred host species. © 2013 Miller and Huppert.

N2  - A framework of general factors for infectious disease emergence was made operational for Campylobacter utilising explanatory variables including time series and risk factor data. These variables were generated using a combination of empirical epidemiology, case-case and case-control studies, time series analysis, and microbial sub-typing (source attribution, diversity, genetic distance) to unravel the changing/emerging aetiology of human campylobacteriosis. The study focused on Scotland between 1990-2012 where there was a 75% increase in reported cases that included >300% increase in the elderly and 50% decrease in young children. During this period there were three phases 1990-2000 a 75% rise and a 20% fall to 2006, followed by a 19% resurgence. The rise coincided with expansions in the poultry industry, consumption of chicken, and a shift from rural to urban cases. The post-2000 fall occurred across all groups apart from the elderly and coincided with a drop of the prevalence of Campylobacter in chicken and a higher proportion of rural cases. The increase in the elderly was associated with uptake of proton pump inhibitors. During the resurgence the increase was predominantly in adults and the elderly, again there was increasing use of PPIs and high prevalences in chicken and ruminants. Cases associated with foreign travel during the study also increased from 9% to a peak of 16% in 2006 before falling to an estimated 10% in 2011, predominantly in adults and older children. During all three periods source attribution, genetic distance, and diversity measurements placed human isolates most similar to those in chickens. A combination of emergence factors generic for infectious diseases were responsible for the Campylobacter epidemic. It was possible to use these to obtain a putative explanation for the changes in human disease and the potential to make an informed view of how incidence rates may change in the future. © 2013 Strachan et al.

N2  - Hepatitis E is a human-zoonosis caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV) which is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. The disease was previously thought to be endemic only in the developing countries of Asia and Africa, but recent studies have shown that HEV is the causative agent of sporadic autochthonous hepatitis and limited epidemics in developed countries of Europe where a high prevalence of hepatitis E is recorded. The transmission routes are still not clearly understood, which makes efforts to estimate the risk of infection unreliable. Although the current epide-miological data on the longitudinal changes of the infection in Europe are inadequate, there has recently been an increase in reports on both hepatitis E prevalence and cases of acute infection. This is a systematic review on hepatitis E analyzing current data on its prevalence in the general population in Europe, including subanalysis of case reports of acute hepatitis E and exploration of longitudinal changes in the disease burden, in an attempt to derive conclusions on hepatitis E epidemiology in Europe. The current bibliography documents a consistently increasing trend, allowing preliminary impressions on the status of hepatitis E epidemiology in Europe. It appears that HEV is the causative agent of limited epidemics. In general, hepatitis E prevalence in Europe is low, but with an increasing trend, particularly in recent years, as reflected by the increasing numbers of reports of acute hepatitis E throughout Europe. There is therefore an urgent need for awareness of the problem on the part of clinicians and for HEV surveillance in the developed countries of Europe. © Athens Medical Society.

N2  - Meningococcal meningitis is a major public health problem in the African Belt. Despite the obvious seasonality of epidemics, the factors driving them are still poorly understood. Here, we provide a first attempt to predict epidemics at the spatio-temporal scale required for in-year response, using a purely empirical approach. District-level weekly incidence rates for Niger (1986-2007) were discretized into latent, alert and epidemic states according to pre-specified epidemiological thresholds. We modelled the probabilities of transition between states, accounting for seasonality and spatio-temporal dependence. One-week-ahead predictions for entering the epidemic state were generated with specificity and negative predictive value >99%, sensitivity and positive predictive value >72%. On the annual scale, we predict the first entry of a district into the epidemic state with sensitivity 65.0%, positive predictive value 49.0%, and an average time gained of 4.6 weeks. These results could inform decisions on preparatory actions. © Cambridge University Press 2012.

N2  - Background: The integration of empirical data in computational frameworks designed to model the spread of infectious diseases poses a number of challenges that are becoming more pressing with the increasing availability of high-resolution information on human mobility and contacts. This deluge of data has the potential to revolutionize the computational efforts aimed at simulating scenarios, designing containment strategies, and evaluating outcomes. However, the integration of highly detailed data sources yields models that are less transparent and general in their applicability. Hence, given a specific disease model, it is crucial to assess which representations of the raw data work best to inform the model, striking a balance between simplicity and detail. Method(s): We consider high-resolution data on the face-to-face interactions of individuals in a pediatric hospital ward, obtained by using wearable proximity sensors. We simulate the spread of a disease in this community by using an SEIR model on top of different mathematical representations of the empirical contact patterns. At the most detailed level, we take into account all contacts between individuals and their exact timing and order. Then, we build a hierarchy of coarse-grained representations of the contact patterns that preserve only partially the temporal and structural information available in the data. We compare the dynamics of the SEIR model across these representations. Result(s): We show that a contact matrix that only contains average contact durations between role classes fails to reproduce the size of the epidemic obtained using the high-resolution contact data and also fails to identify the most at-risk classes. We introduce a contact matrix of probability distributions that takes into account the heterogeneity of contact durations between (and within) classes of individuals, and we show that, in the case study presented, this representation yields a good approximation of the epidemic spreading properties obtained by using the high-resolution data. Conclusion(s): Our results mark a first step towards the definition of synopses of high-resolution dynamic contact networks, providing a compact representation of contact patterns that can correctly inform computational models designed to discover risk groups and evaluate containment policies. We show in a typical case of a structured population that this novel kind of representation can preserve in simulation quantitative features of the epidemics that are crucial for their study and management. © 2013 Machens et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Objectives: China is one of the 22 tuberculosis (TB) high-burden countries in the world. As TB is a major public health problem in China, spatial analysis could be applied to detect geographic distribution of TB clusters for targeted intervention on TB epidemics. Method(s): Spatial analysis was applied for detecting TB clusters on county-based TB notification data in the national notifiable infectious disease case reporting surveillance system from 2005 to 2011. Two indicators of TB epidemic were used including new sputum smear-positive (SS+) notification rate and total TB notification rate. Global Moran's / by ArcGIS was used to assess whether TB clustering and its trend were significant. SaTScan software that used the retrospective space-time analysis and Possion probability model was utilized to identify geographic areas and time period of potential clusters with notification rates on county-level from 2005 to 2011. Result(s): Two indicators of TB notification had presented significant spatial autocorrelation globally each year (p<0.01). Global Moran's I of total TB notification rate had positive trend as time went by (t=6.87, p<0.01). The most likely clusters of two indicators had similar spatial distribution and size in the south-central regions of China from 2006 to 2008, and the secondary clusters in two regions: northeastern China and western China. Besides, the secondary clusters of total TB notification rate had two more large clustering centers in Inner Mongolia, Gansu and Qinghai provinces and several smaller clusters in Shanxi, Henan, Hebei and Jiangsu provinces. Conclusion(s): The total TB notification cases clustered significantly in some special areas each year and the clusters trended to aggregate with time. The most-likely and secondary clusters that overlapped among two TB indicators had higher TB burden and risks of TB transmission. These were the focused geographic areas where TB control efforts should be prioritized. © 2013 Zhao et al.

T1  - A Hierarchical Network Approach for Modeling Rift Valley Fever Epidemics with Applications in North America

N2  - Rift Valley fever is a vector-borne zoonotic disease which causes high morbidity and mortality in livestock. In the event Rift Valley fever virus is introduced to the United States or other non-endemic areas, understanding the potential patterns of spread and the areas at risk based on disease vectors and hosts will be vital for developing mitigation strategies. Presented here is a general network-based mathematical model of Rift Valley fever. Given a lack of empirical data on disease vector species and their vector competence, this discrete time epidemic model uses stochastic parameters following several PERT distributions to model the dynamic interactions between hosts and likely North American mosquito vectors in dispersed geographic areas. Spatial effects and climate factors are also addressed in the model. The model is applied to a large directed asymmetric network of 3,621 nodes based on actual farms to examine a hypothetical introduction to some counties of Texas, an important ranching area in the United States of America. The nodes of the networks represent livestock farms, livestock markets, and feedlots, and the links represent cattle movements and mosquito diffusion between different nodes. Cattle and mosquito (Aedes and Culex) populations are treated with different contact networks to assess virus propagation. Rift Valley fever virus spread is assessed under various initial infection conditions (infected mosquito eggs, adults or cattle). A surprising trend is fewer initial infectious organisms result in a longer delay before a larger and more prolonged outbreak. The delay is likely caused by a lack of herd immunity while the infection expands geographically before becoming an epidemic involving many dispersed farms and animals almost simultaneously. Cattle movement between farms is a large driver of virus expansion, thus quarantines can be efficient mitigation strategy to prevent further geographic spread.

By simulating the within-flock transmission of HPAI using a deterministic S-E-I-R model, and by incorporating an additional environmental class representing infectious faeces, we tracked the build-up of infectious faeces within a poultry house over time. A measure of the transmission risk (TR) was computed for each farm by linking the amount of infectious faeces present each day of an outbreak with data describing the daily on-farm visit schedules for a major British catching company. Larger flocks tended to have greater levels of these catching-team visits. However, where density-dependent contact was assumed, faster outbreak detection (according to an assumed mortality threshold) led to a decreased opportunity for catching-team visits to coincide with an outbreak. For this reason, maximum TR-levels were found for mid-range flock sizes (~25,000-35,000 birds). When assessing all factors simultaneously using multivariable linear regression on the simulated outputs, those related to the pattern of catching-team visits had the largest effect on TR, with the most important movement-related factor depending on the mode of transmission. Using social network analysis on a further database to inform a measure of between-farm connectivity, we identified a large fraction of farms (28%) that had both a high TR and a high potential impact at the between farm level. Our results have counter-intuitive implications for between-farm spread that could not be predicted based on flock size alone, and together with further knowledge of the relative importance of transmission risk and impact, could have implications for improved targeting of control measures. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Objectives: This study was performed to evaluate the epidemiological status of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in the most important endemic foci of Qom Province, central Iran. The city of Qom is the largest center for Shi'a scholarship in the world and is a significant pilgrimage destination. Method(s): During 2006-2011, all suspected CL patients with skin lesion(s) referred to regional health centers of Ghomrood and Ghanavat regions, and all actively detected cases, were examined clinically and parasitologically for CL. Patient information was recorded and patients were categorized based on the number and size of the lesions. Odds ratios (OR) of different risk factors were calculated. Result(s): A total of 849 (59.2% male, 40.8% female) confirmed cases of CL were enrolled; the average incidence rate of the disease was 14.9 per 100. 000 people. During the study period 2006-2011, the trend in CL incidence showed no sudden variations in the areas studied, except for an outbreak of CL in 2009. Leishmania major was identified as the causative agent based on internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) ribosomal DNA PCR analysis. During the study period, the age distribution of CL cases was relatively stable, with the majority (50%) of patients aged 1-25 years. Most cases ( n = 468; 55.1%) had a single lesion and 82 (9.6%) patients had four or more lesions (range 1-29). The risk of developing multiple lesions was significantly increased in patients with seasonal jobs (summer workers) ( p = 0.023; OR 1.516) and significantly decreased in patients who were affected in winter ( p = 0.010; OR 0.398). The risk of developing large-sized lesions (>1. cm) was significantly increased in patients in the age groups >25 years ( p = 0.001-0.015; OR 2.5-3.5) and decreased in patients with seasonal jobs (summer workers) ( p = 0.005; OR 0.570). Conclusion(s): The present data show the importance of CL as a health problem in suburban areas of Qom Province. In order to identify other epidemiological aspects of leishmaniasis in this area, studies on vectors and reservoirs are recommended. Since leishmaniasis caused by L. major is typically zoonotic, control measures should focus on rodents as the main reservoirs and Phlebotomus papatasi as the main vector. Awareness should be raised in the high-risk populations comprising people with diabetes, young adults (<25 years old), and those who work outdoors during the summer. © 2013 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

T1  - Lattice model for influenza spreading with spontaneous behavioral changes
A1  - Fierro A.
A1  - Liccardo A. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Individual behavioral response to the spreading of an epidemic plays a crucial role in the progression of the epidemic itself. The risk perception induces individuals to adopt a protective behavior, as for instance reducing their social contacts, adopting more restrictive hygienic measures or undergoing prophylaxis procedures. In this paper, starting with a previously developed lattice-gas SIR model, we construct a coupled behavior-disease model for influenza spreading with spontaneous behavioral changes. The focus is on self-initiated behavioral changes that alter the susceptibility to the disease, without altering the contact patterns among individuals. Three different mechanisms of awareness spreading are analyzed: the local spreading due to the presence in the neighborhood of infective individuals; the global spreading due to the news published by the mass media and to educational campaigns implemented at institutional level; the local spreading occurring through the "thought contagion" among aware and unaware individuals. The peculiarity of the present approach is that the awareness spreading model is calibrated on available data on awareness and concern of the population about the risk of contagion. In particular, the model is validated against the A(H1N1) epidemic outbreak in Italy during the 2009=2010 season, by making use of the awareness data gathered by the behavioral risk factor surveillance system (PASSI). We find that, increasing the accordance between the simulated awareness spreading and the PASSI data on risk perception, the agreement between simulated and experimental epidemiological data improves as well. Furthermore, we show that, within our model, the primary mechanism to reproduce a realistic evolution of the awareness during an epidemic, is the one due to globally available information. This result highlights how crucial is the role of mass media and educational campaigns in influencing the epidemic spreading of infectious diseases. © 2013 Fierro, Liccardo.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Background: Our aim was to evaluate changes in infectious disease mortality in children in Finland from 1969 to 2004. We especially wanted to find out whether infection mortality could be further reduced by means of existing vaccines not included in national vaccination program. Method(s): We analyzed infectious disease mortality in Finland using data obtained from the official Cause of Death statistics for 1969 to 2004. Annual mortality rates were calculated in proportion to those at risk of dying. Infection mortality rates were calculated separately for neonates and children who were 1 month to 15 years. Result(s): Childhood mortality due to infectious diseases decreased by 89%, from 0.12% in 1969 to 0.013% in 2004, and neonatal mortality by 69%, from 0.50% to 0.16%. Pneumonia, central nervous system infections and septicemia were the most common fatal infections in childhood. There were slightly more deaths due to all infections and respiratory tract infections in years marked by epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus. We estimated that pneumococcal conjugate vaccines would have prevented 2 deaths annually in our population, rotavirus vaccines 1 to 2 deaths, influenza vaccine 1 death and varicella vaccine 0.7 death. Conclusion(s): We found that even though mortality from infectious diseases in childhood decreased markedly during the period concerned, it could have been further reduced by means of existing vaccines. Even though the number of deaths prevented would have been small, the number of years of life saved would have been great because the life expectancy of children is long. © 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Often, when modeling infectious disease spread, the complex network through which the disease propagates is approximated by simplified spatial information. Here, we simulate epidemic spread through various contact networks and fit spatial-based models in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. These spatial models are individual-level models which account for the spatio-temporal dynamics of infectious disease. The focus here is on choosing a spatial model which best predicts the true probabilities of infection, as well as determining under which conditions such spatial models fail. Spatial models tend to predict infection probability reasonably well when disease spread is propagated through contact networks in which contacts are only within a certain distance of each other. If contacts exist over long distances, the spatial models tend to perform worse when compared to the network model. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Hospital isolation rooms are vital for the containment (when under negative pressure) of patients with, or the protection (when under positive pressure) of patients, from airborne infectious agents. Such facilities were essential for the management of highly contagious patients during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks and the more recent 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. Many different types of door designs are used in the construction of such isolation rooms, which may be related to the space available and affordability. Using colored food dye as a tracer, the qualitative effects of door-opening motions on the dissemination of potentially contaminated air into and out of a single isolation room were visualized and filmed using Reynolds-number-equivalent, small-scale, water-tank models fitted with programmable door-opening and moving human figure motions. Careful scaling considerations involved in the design and construction of these water-tank models enabled these results to be accurately extrapolated to the full-scale situation. Four simple types of door design were tested: variable speed single and double, sliding and hinged doors, in combination with the moving human figure. The resulting video footage was edited, synchronized and presented in a series of split-screen formats. From these experiments, it is clear that double-hinged doors pose the greatest risk of leakage into or out of the room, followed by (in order of decreasing risk) single-hinged, double-sliding and single-sliding doors. The relative effect of the moving human figure on spreading any potential contamination was greatest with the sliding doors, as the bulk airflows induced were large relative to those resulting from these door-opening motions. However, with the hinged doors, the airflows induced by these door-opening motions were significantly greater. Further experiments involving a simulated ventilated environment are required, but from these findings alone, it appears that sliding-doors are far more effective for hospital isolation room containment. © 2013 Tang et al.

N2  - Infectious disease outbreaks are uncertain and potentially risky events that often attract significant media attention. Previous research has shown that, regardless of their objective severity, diseases receiving greater coverage in the media are considered to be more serious and more representative of a disease than those receiving less coverage. This study assesses the role of media coverage in estimations of population risk (measured as perceived incidence among a specific population within a 1-year time period) and personal risk (measured as perceived personal likelihood of infection). Diseases with higher media coverage were considered more serious and more representative of a disease, and estimated to have lower incidence, than diseases less frequently found in the media. No difference in estimates of personal risk was found. A significant correlation between estimates of population and personal risk was found for diseases infrequently reported in the media. A weaker correlation between estimates of population and personal risk was found for diseases frequently reported in the media. The correlation remained unchanged when participants were exposed to additional information, including symptoms, mortality and estimates of prevalence. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Noroviruses (NoVs) are the major cause of acute epidemic gastroenteritis in industrialized countries. Outbreak strains are predominantly genogroup II (GII) NoV, but genogroup I (GI) strains are regularly found in oyster related outbreaks. The prototype Norwalk virus (GI), has been shown to have high infectivity in a human challenge study. Whether other NoVs are equally infectious via natural exposure remains to be established. Human susceptibility to NoV is partly determined by the secretor status (Se+/-). Data from five published oyster related outbreaks were analyzed in a Bayesian framework. Infectivity estimates where high and consistent with NV(GI) infectivity, for both GII and GI strains. The median and CI95 probability of infection and illness, in Se+ subjects, associated with exposure to a mean of one single NoV genome copy were around 0.29[0.015-0.61] for GI and 0.4[0.04-0.61] for GII, and for illness 0.13[0.007-0.39] for GI and 0.18[0.017-0.42] for GII. Se- subjects were strongly protected against infection. The high infectivity estimates for Norwalk virus GI and GII, makes NoVs critical target for food safety regulations. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Altered Immunity in Crowded Locust Reduced Fungal (Metarhizium anisopliae) Pathogenesis

N2  - The stress of living conditions, similar to infections, alters animal immunity. High population density is empirically considered to induce prophylactic immunity to reduce the infection risk, which was challenged by a model of low connectivity between infectious and susceptible individuals in crowded animals. The migratory locust, which exhibits polyphenism through gregarious and solitary phases in response to population density and displays different resistance to fungal biopesticide (Metarhizium anisopliae), was used to observe the prophylactic immunity of crowded animals. We applied an RNA-sequencing assay to investigate differential expression in fat body samples of gregarious and solitary locusts before and after infection. Solitary locusts devoted at least twice the number of genes for combating M. anisopliae infection than gregarious locusts. The transcription of immune molecules such as pattern recognition proteins, protease inhibitors, and anti-oxidation proteins, was increased in prophylactic immunity of gregarious locusts. The differentially expressed transcripts reducing gregarious locust susceptibility to M. anisopliae were confirmed at the transcriptional and translational level. Further investigation revealed that locust GNBP3 was susceptible to proteolysis while GNBP1, induced by M. anisopliae infection, resisted proteolysis. Silencing of gnbp3 by RNAi significantly shortened the life span of gregarious locusts but not solitary locusts. By contrast, gnbp1 silencing did not affect the life span of both gregarious and solitary locusts after M. anisopliae infection. Thus, the GNBP3-dependent immune responses were involved in the phenotypic resistance of gregarious locusts to fungal infection, but were redundant in solitary locusts. Our results indicated that gregarious locusts prophylactically activated upstream modulators of immune cascades rather than downstream effectors, preferring to quarantine rather than eliminate pathogens to conserve energy meanwhile increasing the "distance" of infectious and target individuals. Our study has obvious implications for bio-pesticides management of crowded pests, and for understanding disease epidemics and adaptiveness of pathogens. © 2013 Wang et al.

T1  - Small oversights that led to the Great Plague of Marseille (1720-1723): Lessons from the past
A1  - Devaux C.A. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - In recent decades, the issue of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases has become an increasingly important area of concern in public health. Today, like centuries ago, infectious diseases confront us with the fear of death and have heavily influenced social behaviors and policy decisions at local, national and international levels. Remarkably, an infectious disease such as plague, which is disseminated from one country to another mainly by commercial transportation, remains today, as it was in the distant past, a threat for human societies. Throughout history, plague outbreaks prevailed on numerous occasions in Mediterranean harbors, including Marseille in the south of France. A few months ago, the municipal authorities of the city of Marseille, announced the archaeological discovery of the last remnants of a "lazaretto" or "lazaret" (http://20.minutes.fr, March 3th, 2012), a place equipped with an infirmary and destined to isolate ship passengers quarantined for health reasons. More recently, on September 16th, 2012, the anchor of the ship "Grand Saint Antoine" responsible for bringing the plague to Marseille in 1720, was recovered and it will be restored before being presented to the public in 2013 (http://www.libemarseille.fr/henry/2012/09/lancre-du-bateau-qui-amena-la-grande-peste-%C3%A0-marseille.html). In the light of these recent archaeological discoveries, it is quite instructive to revisit the sequence of events and decisions that led to the outbreak of the Great Plague of Marseille between 1720 and 1723. It comes to the evidence that although the threat was known and health surveillance existed with quite effective preventive measures such as quarantine, the accumulation of small negligence led to one of the worst epidemics in the city (about 30% of casualties among the inhabitants). This is an excellent model to illustrate the issues we are facing with emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases today and to define how to improve biosurveillance and response tomorrow. Importantly, the risk of plague dissemination by transport trade is negligible between developed countries, however, this risk still persists in developing countries. In addition, the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of Yersinia pestis, the infectious agent of plague, is raising serious concerns for public health. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has become a leading cause of non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related morbidity and mortality for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. Despite injection drug use (IDU) remaining the main route of HCV infection, recent reports indicate outbreaks of acute HCV infection among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) and sexually transmitted infections in the absence of IDU. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective observational study of behavioural and demographic factors of patients with and without incident HCV infection among HIV-infected individuals followed at the AIDS Clinic of the Infectious Disease Department of the University of Ancona from 1989 to 2011. Result(s): Overall, 440 patients were considered; a total of 145 patients had initial positive HCV antibody test results (HCV+); a total of 295 patients had initial negative HCV antibody test results (HCV-). In the latter population, 14 seroconverted to HCV antibody (neoHCV), with an overall incidence of 0.59 per 100 person-years. While IDU was the principal risk factor of HCV+, the main route of transmission of incident HCV infection was sexual transmission. The HCV- group was significantly older than the other two groups and showed a significantly lower CD4 count at HIV diagnosis than neoHCV. Being Italian and having a low level of education were significantly more represented in HCV+. Younger age at HIV infection, IDU and additional risk factors other than sexual transmission significantly affected the probability of being HCV+. The cumulative probability of developing HCV infection in the HCV- group was calculated to be 6 % at 15 years. Conclusion(s): The epidemiology of the newly acquired HCV in HIV+ persons is changing. Therefore, a frequent and constant counselling about HCV infection is desirable and a periodical screening test is mandatory. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Among the many challenges to health, infectious diseases stand out for their ability to have a profound impact on humans and animals. The recent years have witnessed an increasing number of novel infectious diseases. The numerous examples of infections which originated from animals suggest that the zoonotic pool is an important and potentially rich source of emerging diseases. Since emergence and re-emergence of pathogens, and particularly zoonotic agents, occur at unpredictable rates in animal and human populations, infectious diseases will constitute a significant challenge for the public health and animal health communities in the twenty-first century. The African continent suffers from one of the highest burdens of infectious diseases of humans and animals in the world but has the least capacity for their detection, identification and monitoring. Lessons learnt from recent zoonotic epidemics in Africa and elsewhere clearly indicate the need for coordinated research, interdisciplinary centres, response systems and infrastructures, integrated surveillance systems and workforce development strategies. More and stronger partnerships across national and international sectors (human health, animal health, environment) and disciplines (natural and social sciences) involving public, academic and private organisations and institutions will be required to meet the present and future challenges of infectious diseases. In order to strengthen the efficiency of early warning systems, monitoring trends and disease prediction and timely outbreak interventions for the benefit of the national and international community, it is essential that each nation improves its own capacity in disease recognition and laboratory competence. The SACIDS, a One Health African initiative linking southern African academic and research institutions in smart partnership with centres of science excellence in industrialised countries as well as international research centres, strives to strengthen Africa's capacity to detect, identify and monitor infectious diseases of humans and animals, to better manage health and socio-economic risks posed by them, and to improve research capacity in investigation the biologic, socio-economic, ecologic and anthropogenic factors responsible for emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

T1  - Inferring the Source of Transmission with Phylogenetic Data
A1  - Volz E.M.
A1  - Frost S.D.W. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Identifying the source of transmission using pathogen genetic data is complicated by numerous biological, immunological, and behavioral factors. A large source of error arises when there is incomplete or sparse sampling of cases. Unsampled cases may act as either a common source of infection or as an intermediary in a transmission chain for hosts infected with genetically similar pathogens. It is difficult to quantify the probability of common source or intermediate transmission events, which has made it difficult to develop statistical tests to either confirm or deny putative transmission pairs with genetic data. We present a method to incorporate additional information about an infectious disease epidemic, such as incidence and prevalence of infection over time, to inform estimates of the probability that one sampled host is the direct source of infection of another host in a pathogen gene genealogy. These methods enable forensic applications, such as source-case attribution, for infectious disease epidemics with incomplete sampling, which is usually the case for high-morbidity community-acquired pathogens like HIV, Influenza and Dengue virus. These methods also enable epidemiological applications such as the identification of factors that increase the risk of transmission. We demonstrate these methods in the context of the HIV epidemic in Detroit, Michigan, and we evaluate the suitability of current sequence databases for forensic and epidemiological investigations. We find that currently available sequences collected for drug resistance testing of HIV are unlikely to be useful in most forensic investigations, but are useful for identifying transmission risk factors. © 2013 Volz, Frost.

T1  - Epidemic Spread on Weighted Networks
A1  - Kamp C.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - The contact structure between hosts shapes disease spread. Most network-based models used in epidemiology tend to ignore heterogeneity in the weighting of contacts between two individuals. However, this assumption is known to be at odds with the data for many networks (e.g. sexual contact networks) and to have a critical influence on epidemics' behavior. One of the reasons why models usually ignore heterogeneity in transmission is that we currently lack tools to analyze weighted networks, such that most studies rely on numerical simulations. Here, we present a novel framework to estimate key epidemiological variables, such as the rate of early epidemic expansion (r0), from joint probability distributions of number of partners (contacts) and number of interaction events through which contacts are weighted. These distributions are much easier to infer than the exact shape of the network, which makes the approach widely applicable. The framework also allows for a derivation of the full time course of epidemic prevalence and contact behaviour, which we validate with numerical simulations on networks. Overall, incorporating more realistic contact networks into epidemiological models can improve our understanding of the emergence and spread of infectious diseases. © 2013 Kamp et al.

T1  - Extinction times of epidemic outbreaks in networks
A1  - Holme P. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - In the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model of disease spreading, the time to extinction of the epidemics happens at an intermediate value of the per-contact transmission probability. Too contagious infections burn out fast in the population. Infections that are not contagious enough die out before they spread to a large fraction of people. We characterize how the maximal extinction time in SIR simulations on networks depend on the network structure. For example we find that the average distances in isolated components, weighted by the component size, is a good predictor of the maximal time to extinction. Furthermore, the transmission probability giving the longest outbreaks is larger than, but otherwise seemingly independent of, the epidemic threshold. © 2013 Petter Holme.

N2  - When facing incursion of a major livestock infectious disease, the decision to implement a vaccination programme is made at the national level. To make this decision, governments must consider whether the benefits of vaccination are sufficient to outweigh potential additional costs, including further trade restrictions that may be imposed due to the implementation of vaccination. However, little consensus exists on the factors triggering its implementation on the field. This work explores the effect of several triggers in the implementation of a reactive vaccination-to-live policy when facing epidemics of foot-and-mouth disease. In particular, we tested whether changes in the location of the incursion and the delay of implementation would affect the epidemiological benefit of such a policy in the context of Scotland. To reach this goal, we used a spatial, premises-based model that has been extensively used to investigate the effectiveness of mitigation procedures in Great Britain. The results show that the decision to vaccinate, or not, is not straightforward and strongly depends on the underlying local structure of the population-at-risk. With regards to disease incursion preparedness, simply identifying areas of highest population density may not capture all complexities that may influence the spread of disease as well as the benefit of implementing vaccination. However, if a decision to vaccinate is made, we show that delaying its implementation in the field may markedly reduce its benefit. This work provides guidelines to support policy makers in their decision to implement, or not, a vaccination-to-live policy when facing epidemics of infectious livestock disease. © 2013 Porphyre et al.

N2  - BackgroundBlastomycosis is a potentially life-threatening infection caused by the soil-based dimorphic fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis, which is endemic throughout much of the Midwestern United States. We investigated an increase in reported cases of blastomycosis that occurred during 2009-2010 in Marathon County, Wisconsin.MethodsCase detection was conducted using the Wisconsin Electronic Disease Surveillance System (WEDSS). WEDSS data were used to compare demographic, clinical, and exposure characteristics between outbreak-related and historical case patients, and to calculate blastomycosis incidence rates. Because initial mapping of outbreak case patients' homes and recreational sites demonstrated unusual neighborhood and household case clustering, we conducted a 1:3 matched case-control study to identify factors associated with being in a geographic cluster.ResultsAmong the 55 patients with outbreak-related cases, 33 (70%) were hospitalized, 2 (5%) died, 30 (55%) had cluster-related cases, and 20 (45%) were Hmong. The overall incidence increased significantly since 2005 (average 11% increase per year, P <. 001), and incidence during 2005-2010 was significantly higher among Asians than non-Asians (2010 incidence: 168 vs 13 per 100 000 population). Thirty of the outbreak cases grouped into 5 residential clusters. Outdoor activities were not risk factors for blastomycosis among cluster case patients or when comparing outbreak cases to historical cases.ConclusionsThis outbreak of blastomycosis, the largest ever reported, was characterized by unique household and neighborhood clustering likely related to multifocal environmental sources. The reasons for the large number of Hmong affected are unclear, but may involve genetic predisposition. © 2013 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Infectious Diseases Society of America 2013.

N2  - Background. In late 2011 and early 2012, 13 cases of human influenza resulted from infection with a novel triple reassortant swine-origin influenza virus, influenza A (H3N2) variant. This variant was notable for its inclusion of the matrix gene from the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic virus. While most of these confirmed cases were among children, the transmission potential and likely age-dependent susceptibility to the virus was unknown. Preliminary serologic studies indicated that very young children have less protection than older children and adults.Methods. We construct a mathematical transmission model of influenza transmission that allows for external zoonotic exposure to infection and show how exposure and susceptibility-related factors contribute to the observed case distribution.Results and Conclusions. Age-dependent susceptibility to infection strongly influences epidemic dynamics. The result is that the risk of an outbreak in a highly susceptible age group may be substantially higher than in an older age group with less susceptibility, but exposure-related factors must also be accounted for when interpreting case data. © 2013 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

T1  - Bursts of Vertex Activation and Epidemics in Evolving Networks
A1  - Rocha L.E.C.
A1  - Blondel V.D. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - The dynamic nature of contact patterns creates diverse temporal structures. In particular, empirical studies have shown that contact patterns follow heterogeneous inter-event time intervals, meaning that periods of high activity are followed by long periods of inactivity. To investigate the impact of these heterogeneities in the spread of infection from a theoretical perspective, we propose a stochastic model to generate temporal networks where vertices make instantaneous contacts following heterogeneous inter-event intervals, and may leave and enter the system. We study how these properties affect the prevalence of an infection and estimate R0, the number of secondary infections of an infectious individual in a completely susceptible population, by modeling simulated infections (SI and SIR) that co-evolve with the network structure. We find that heterogeneous contact patterns cause earlier and larger epidemics in the SIR model in comparison to homogeneous scenarios for a vast range of parameter values, while smaller epidemics may happen in some combinations of parameters. In the case of SI and heterogeneous patterns, the epidemics develop faster in the earlier stages followed by a slowdown in the asymptotic limit. For increasing vertex turnover rates, heterogeneous patterns generally cause higher prevalence in comparison to homogeneous scenarios with the same average inter-event interval. We find that R0 is generally higher for heterogeneous patterns, except for sufficiently large infection duration and transmission probability. © 2013 Rocha, Blondel.

N2  - Background. Mortality among patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is high. Because of high age and multiple underlying diseases, CDI-related mortality is difficult to estimate. We estimated CDI-related mortality in an endemic situation, not influenced by outbreaks and consequently certain patients and C. difficile strains.Methods. Between 2006 and 2009, 13 Dutch hospitals included all hospitalized CDI patients. Nine hospitals individually matched each CDI patient to 2 control patients, based on ward and time of CDI hospitalization. Survival status was obtained via the Dutch Civil Registration System. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression were used for survival analysis.Results. We identified 1366 patients with CDI (1.33 per 1000 admissions). All-cause mortality risk was 13% after 30 days and 37% after 1 year. The highest mortality was seen among elderly patients and patients with polymerase chain reaction ribotype 027. Three hundred seventeen CDI patients were matched to 317 patients without diarrhea and 232 patients with diarrhea, with a 30-day mortality risk of 5.4% and 8.6%, respectively. CDI patients had a 2.5-fold increased 30-day mortality rate compared to controls without diarrhea (hazard ratio 2.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.4-4.3]) when adjusted for age, sex, and underlying diseases. CDI-related death occurred mainly within 30 days after diagnosis.Conclusions. Mortality among CDI patients is high, even in an endemic situation. Our results show that CDI is associated with to a 2.5-fold increase in 30-day mortality. This highlights the considerable disease burden and clinical impact of CDI, even in absence of an outbreak. © 2013 The Author 2013.

T1  - Sample Size Considerations for One-to-One Animal Transmission Studies of the Influenza A Viruses
A1  - Nishiura H.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Background: Animal transmission studies can provide important insights into host, viral and environmental factors affecting transmission of viruses including influenza A. The basic unit of analysis in typical animal transmission experiments is the presence or absence of transmission from an infectious animal to a susceptible animal. In studies comparing two groups (e.g. two host genetic variants, two virus strains, or two arrangements of animal cages), differences between groups are evaluated by comparing the proportion of pairs with successful transmission in each group. The present study aimed to discuss the significance and power to estimate transmissibility and identify differences in the transmissibility based on one-to-one trials. The analyses are illustrated on transmission studies of influenza A viruses in the ferret model. Methodology/Principal Findings: Employing the stochastic general epidemic model, the basic reproduction number, R0, is derived from the final state of an epidemic and is related to the probability of successful transmission during each one-to-one trial. In studies to estimate transmissibility, we show that 3 pairs of infectious/susceptible animals cannot demonstrate a significantly higher transmissibility than R0 = 1, even if infection occurs in all three pairs. In comparisons between two groups, at least 4 pairs of infectious/susceptible animals are required in each group to ensure high power to identify significant differences in transmissibility between the groups. Conclusion(s): These results inform the appropriate sample sizes for animal transmission experiments, while relating the observed proportion of infected pairs to R0, an interpretable epidemiological measure of transmissibility. In addition to the hypothesis testing results, the wide confidence intervals of R0 with small sample sizes also imply that the objective demonstration of difference or similarity should rest on firmly calculated sample size. © 2013 Nishiura et al.

T1  - Number-needed-to-vaccinate calculations: Fallacies associated with exclusion of transmission
A1  - Tuite A.R.
A1  - Fisman D.N. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Background: Number-needed-to-vaccinate (NNV) calculations are used with increasing frequency as metrics of the attractiveness of vaccination programs. However, such calculations as typically applied consider only the direct protective effects of vaccination and ignore indirect effects generated through reduction of force of infection (i.e., risk of infection in susceptible individuals). We postulated that such calculations could produce profoundly biased estimates of vaccine attractiveness. Method(s): We used mathematical models simulating endemic and epidemic diseases with a variety of epidemiological characteristics, and in the face of varying approaches to immunization, to evaluate biases associated with exclusion of transmission. We generated number-needed-to-vaccinate calculations using both traditional methods, and using a more realistic approach that defines this quantity as the ratio of cases prevented through vaccination (directly or indirectly) to individuals vaccinated. We quantified bias as the ratio of estimates produced using these two different methods. Result(s): Across a range of simulated infectious diseases with variable epidemiological characteristics, and in the context of both pulsed vaccination and ongoing vaccine programs, traditional NNV calculations based on systems using plausible infectious disease parameters produced estimates biased by up to 3 orders of magnitude (i.e., 1000 fold). Unbiased NNV estimates were seen only in the context of diseases with extremely high reproductive numbers that could be prevented with highly efficacious vaccines. Conclusion(s): When evaluated using mathematical models that simulate common vaccine-preventable diseases of public health importance, typical number-needed-to-vaccinate calculation produce marked over-estimates relative to NNV calculations incorporating the fundamental transmissibility of communicable diseases. NNV calculations should be used with caution and interpreted critically when used as metrics for the potential community-level impact of vaccination programs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Infectious risk of endovaginal and transrectal ultrasonography: Systematic review and meta-analysis
A1  - Leroy S. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Background: Appropriate endovaginal/rectal ultrasound transducer disinfection has been an ongoing and vexed question in gynaecology, obstetrics and urology. However, the routine use of probe covers followed by low-level disinfection (wipes/spray) is usually applied between patients in some countries (e.g. France). Aim(s): To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the scientific literature in order to identify case reports of contamination following endovaginal/rectal probe use, and to estimate the infection prevalence related to the use of these probes in common daily practice. Method(s): Systematic review and meta-analysis. Result(s): From the 867 potentially eligible references, 32 articles were finally included. Very few cases with an established route of contamination had been reported. Indeed, apart from occurrence of outbreaks, it is difficult if not impossible to detect viral contamination through the use of endovaginal/rectal ultrasound probes. However, there was a pooled prevalence of 12.9% (95% confidence interval: 1.7-24.3) for pathogenic bacteria, and 1.0% (0.0-10.0) for frequently occurring virus (human papillomavirus, herpes simplex virus, and cytomegalovirus) for endovaginal/rectal probes, both after low-level disinfection. The pooled prevalence of infected patients after transrectal ultrasound and guided biopsies was estimated to be 3.1% (1.6-4.3). Conclusion(s): There appears to be a risk of transmitting bacterial or viral infections via endovaginal/rectal ultrasound transducer, and the present meta-analysis provides an estimate of this risk. Further research with sophisticated modelling is warranted to quantify the risk. © 2012 The Healthcare Infection Society.

N2  - Metapopulation rescue effects are thought to be key to the persistence of many acute immunizing infections. Yet the enhancement of persistence through spatial coupling has not been previously quantified. Here we estimate the metapopulation rescue effects for four childhood infections using global WHO reported incidence data by comparing persistence on island countries vs all other countries, while controlling for key variables such as vaccine cover, birth rates and economic development. The relative risk of extinction on islands is significantly higher, and approximately double the risk of extinction in mainland countries. Furthermore, as may be expected, infections with longer infectious periods tend to have the strongest metapopulation rescue effects. Our results quantitate the notion that demography and local community size controls disease persistence. © 2013 Metcalf et al.

N2  - Purpose: Brilliant Blue G (BBG) is A safe and effective dye used to highlight the internal limiting membrane during macular surgery. A recent outbreak of BBG associated Fusarium spp. endophthalmitis raises concerns about this off-label, non-FDA approved intraocular use. We propose that the utilization of A 0.22 um filter intraoperatively can reduce the risk of inoculating an eye with contaminated BBG. Method(s): An in vitro model of contaminated BBG was prepared. Laboratory stock cultures of 7 organisms including Staphyloccocus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphyloccocus aureus, Haemophilus influenza, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Fusarium spp., and Candida albicans were prepared in five 10-fold dilutions and injected into BBG vials. These mixtures were drawn with either A 5 um filter, 0.22 um, or without A filter and cultured on appropriate plates and growth conditions. Result(s): No culture plates that had inoculate drawn through A 0.22 um filter showed evidence of growth. There was evidence of growth for all organisms when no filter was used. A 5 um was insufficient to filter Fusarium spp. Conclusion(s): Using A 0.22 um filter in the intraoperative processing of BBG would likely reduce the risk of infectious endophthalmitis resulting from contaminated dye.

N2  - Introduction: In Finland, incidence of CDI increased during 2002-2006, shown by the population-based analysis of hospital discharge diagnoses, a trend similar to that in the US. In 2008, toxin-positive C. difficile became a notifiable disease. During the first 3 years of surveillance, the annual incidence decreased from 111 to 90/100,000 population, but rose up to 100 in 2011. The epidemic situation and trends differed regionally. Both PPI and FQ use have been associated with increased risk of CDI. Objective(s): To study whether the use of antibiotics, FQs and PPIs were associated with regional differences in CDI rates. Method(s): Data on CDI incidence during 2008-2011 in 21 hospital districts (HD) was obtained from the National Infectious Disease Registry and consumption of antibiotics and PPIs from the Finnish Medical Agency. The availability of molecular methods in diagnostics was obtained by a laboratory survey and data on FQ resistant ribotypes from the national reference laboratory. Negative binomial regression model was performed to assess the impact of different antibiotics, PPIs, the presence of ribotype 027 CD and the use of molecular diagnostic methods in the respective HD on CDI incidence. Variable selection in the model was done by using Akaike information criteria (AIC). Result(s): The level of FQ use was stable during 2008-2011 (although it had doubled during 1990-2000). The use of PPI increased 50% during 2008-2011. FQ use was strongly associated with the CDI incidence, and there was a trend between PPI use and the CDI incidence in different HDs. The presence of molecular methods (including PCR) or the knowledge of ribotype 027 being detected in the HD was not associated with the CDI incidence. According to AIC, in the final multivariable model, we only included FQ use. The incidence rate ratio for FQs was 2.45 (95% CI, 1.58-3.79; p<0.001). Conclusion(s): FQ use was an important risk factor for CDI, as shown previously. However, the use has stabilized during the last few years. In the national guidelines, FQs are included in the choices to treat urinary tract infections but not respiratory tract infections. The increasing use of PPIs is of note.

N2  - Objectives Recently the WHO estimated that up to 75% of emerging pathogens may be of zoonotic origin. Occupationally acquired zoonoses are of particular concern in food producing sectors because of the possibility of transmission through the food chain. We aim to investigate whether changes in incidence of occupationally-acquired zoonotic infections in agricultural and veterinary workers or food preparation and food retail workers are useful in predicting changes in the incidence of food-borne zoonotic infections in the wider population. Methods In the UK infectious disease consultants report cases of occupationally acquired infectious disease to the Surveillance of Infectious Diseases at Work (SIDAW) scheme. Cases reported to SIDAW will be analysed using a 2 level negative binomial regression model adjusted for changes in the size of occupational group at risk as described elsewhere1. Following a target set by the UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) in 2001 to reduce the incidence of salmonella in UK produced chicken there has been a declining trend in outbreaks of food-borne salmonellosis. In contrast there has been little change in the number of outbreaks of food-borne camphylobacteriosis reported to the HPA over the same time. These trends reported to the HPA will be compared with SWORD data. Results Between 1997 and 2010, 244 individual cases (209 outbreaks) of salmonellosis and 577 individual cases (522 outbreaks) of camphylobacterosis were reported to SWORD. Over the same time period 590 foodborne outbreaks of salmonellosis and 105 of camphylobacterosis were reported to the HPA. A simultaneous decline in the incidence of salmonellosis reported to SWORD and food-borne salmonellosis reported to the HPA was observed. These data will be analysed further to compare different occupational sectors. Conclusion Reporting of occupational infectious diseases in some sectors may be a useful marker for changes in incidence occurring in the wider population.

T1  - Epidemiology: Risk of transmission in various regions of the world and prevention of routes of transmission

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - It is estimated that approximately 130-180 million individuals, or 2-3% of the world population, are infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Globally, the prevalence varies widely, with lowest figures (<=0.5%) from Northern European countries, and the highest ones from some African countries, such as Egypt and Cameroon. Classically, until serological assays became available, the main routes of HCV transmission were blood transfusion, unsafe medical procedures and sharing tools for intravenous drug use. Together, these routes account for about 70% of chronic HCV infections in developed countries, with a peak incidence having occurred in the 1980's. After HCV was discovered, screening assays and preventive measures dramatically reduced iatrogenous transmission of HCV in these countries, where the vast majority of new infections now occur among illicit drug users. In addition to the classical harm reduction programs, mathematical models suggest that a test-and-treat policy may dramatically curb the spread of HCV also in this setting. On the other hand, the perinatal and heterosexual transmission is infrequent, although some outbreaks have been reported in the male homosexual community. The situation is quite different in resource-poor countries, where lack of public awareness and the persisting use of unsafe medical tools still account for the majority of new HCV infections. While the HCV pandemic has been systematically studied and characterized in developed countries, it has not received a sufficiently thorough appreciation in other regions. Thus, available estimates have limitations, as they may be based on outdated surveys or studies carried out on samples that are not representative of the general population. Furthermore, it is uncertain what is the percentage of individuals who are unaware of their infection, although the average figure is commonly put at approximately 50% of the overall infected reservoir. To complicate the picture, migratory movements, involving approximately more than 200,000,000 persons worldwide, are reshaping the epidemiology of several infectious agents, including HCV. As decisions on public health issues depend on reliable epidemiological data, a better awareness of the HCV pandemic among all stakeholders is necessary.

N2  - The worldwide burden of cancer and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is increasing. In 2005, NCDs were estimated to have caused more than 60% (35 million) of all deaths worldwide. For cancer an estimated 7.6 million deaths occurred in 2008 (around 20% of all NCD deaths). Without prevention or control the total cancer deaths is projected to rise to 13.1 million by 2030 whilst incidence will rise from 12.7 million in 2008 to 21.3 in 2030 based on demographic changes alone. The greatest percent increases will be in countries falling within the low and medium Human Development Index (HDI) categories. This phenomenon is mainly a consequence of the epidemiologic transition, i.e., a shift from infectious diseases to NCDs. Wider adoption of specific aspects of westernized lifestyles would translate to still greater increases in certain cancer types. In many countries the burden of cancer and other NCDs will therefore add to communicable diseases and malnutrition to impose a "double burden" on the poorest. These trends represent major challenges to health, poverty, sustainable development and equality. One consequence, especially in the lower HDI countries, is the implausibility of treating our way out of the cancer epidemic. Large variations in the type and number of cancers are observed in different regions of the world. Within high- and very high-HDI countries, prostate and breast cancers are the most common in males and females respectively, with lung and colorectal cancers ranking next in both sexes. Within low-HDI countries lung and breast cancers remain among the most common, but cancers of the cervix, stomach, liver, and Kaposi sarcoma are also among the leading types - all of which are cancers with infection-related aetiology. Medium-HDI countries are intermediate with respect to their patterns of cancer burden, reflecting an on-going transition from infection-related cancers to those most associated with a westernized lifestyle. The three most common types of cancer in medium-HDI countries are lung, stomach and liver cancers in males, and breast, cervix and lung cancer in females. In face of these increases in burden and variations in types of cancer, both primary and secondary cancer prevention offer many opportunities through implementing existing knowledge about environmental and lifestyle risk factors and using the natural history of the disease to establish screening and early detection. Reducing tobacco consumption through primary prevention has the capacity to contribute globally to the largest number of cancer deaths avoided; implementation of the international treaty of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is vital. Effective tobacco control efforts have resulted in substantial declines in tobacco-related cancer deaths in the USA and several European countries demonstrating the effectiveness of a range of control methods. In relation to diet there are a number of clear potentially modifiable risk factors. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of breast, colorectal, endometrium, kidney, oesophageal and pancreatic cancers. Physical inactivity is also associated with breast, colorectal and endometrium cancer. Much less is known about specific nutrients or dietary components, although alcohol is associated with increased risks of liver, aero-digestive tract, breast and colorectal cancers; the consumption of red and processed meats as well as a diet low in fibre has also been associated with colorectal cancer. Recent estimates reported about 2 million cancer cases per year (16% of the global cancer burden) attributable to chronic infections, principally human papillomavirus (HPV); hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV); and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). The contribution is substantially larger in low-resource countries (that include low- and medium-HDI countries) (26%) than in high-resource countries (8%) making the prevention or eradication of these infections a powerful tool to overcome inequalities in cancer incidence between poor and rich populations. Priorities include vaccination against HBV and HPV and avoidance of HCV transmission. Environmental causes of cancer, encompassing environmental contaminants or pollutants (e.g. radon, indoor and outdoor air pollution), naturally occurring toxins (e.g. aflatoxins, arsenic), occupationally-related exposures (e.g. asbestos) and radiation (X-rays and gamma radiation, as well as sunlight and UV tanning devices) can make substantial contributions to specific cancers or cancer clusters on a smaller scale. These exposures can also be amenable to low-cost modification by regulation, thus reducing the burden of some very lethal cancers with straightforward operable measures. The majority of cancers have a long latent phase and are preceded by pre-neoplastic lesions. Early detection and treatment of cancer or precancerous lesions resulted in substantial declines in cancer mortality in high-resource countries and would greatly improve survival in low-resource countries where access to expensive cancer treatment is limited. Firm evidence of efficacy of screening programmes in the reduction of cancer mortality exists for three cancer sites: the cervix uteri, breast, and colon-rectum. In relation to the lower HDI countries in particular there is a need to evaluate alternatives to mammographic screening for early detection of breast cancer. These may initially include improvements in breast awareness among women and health workers; facilitation of access of women with clinically detectable lumps to high-quality diagnostic facilities and of women with breast cancer to effective systemic treatment. Whilst much can be achieved based on current knowledge there is an important caveat. Namely, that knowing the cause does not automatically translate to having a strategy for prevention. For example, it is likely that a large proportion of stomach cancer could be prevented by H. pylori control, but currently neither a mechanism to achieve this, nor the effectiveness if achieved, is known. In analogous fashion far more research is required into behavioural change in relation to lifestyle factors such as diet, obesity and physical activity. Even for existing prevention strategies additional work is needed on their implementation into health care settings, particularly in lower HDI countries. At the same time, for a number of major cancers (e.g., colon, prostate, kidney, pancreas, brain, lympho-haematological malignancies) research is needed to identify as yet unknown risk factors. Finally, there is a remarkable opportunity for the recent advances in understanding the molecular basis of carcinogenesis to provide new tools and insights into aetiology and prevention. Among these opportunities are: improved exposure assessment; elucidation of mechanistic pathways related to defined exposures; identification of molecular markers which indicate risk of disease progression; and stratification of cancer cases by molecular subtype in relation to specific exposures. This broader concept of translational cancer research and its potential to inform cancer prevention stands at an exciting but critical point in time. It is only by complementing efforts to improve treatment with those aimed at prevention that the impending epidemic of this disease can be addressed.

N2  - Dengue is the most important arboviral infection in humans, whose frequency has increased in the world over the past 30 years. In tropical countries is essential to differentiate dengue from other infectious diseases. We assembled a cohort of febrile patients recruited from 2003 to 2011, during an epidemic and a non-epidemic dengue period in Colombia. Patients underwent clinical evaluation and hematologic testing within 3 days after the onset of fever. Dengue confirmed cases (DCC) had to have an IgM seroconversion from acute to convalescence samples, a fourfold increase in IgM titers or a positive virologic test (RT-PCR, viral isolation or NS1). Patients not meeting these criteria were referred to as non-dengue cases (NDC). We used multiple logistic regression to determine the contribution of predictors to the likelihood of DCC. We evaluated 1,476 febrile patients (49% DCC, mean age: 22.9 years). Patients with respiratory symptoms - rhinorrhea and cough - were 49% less likely to be DCCs (OR=0.51, 95%CI: 0.40-0.66). Other symptoms such as vomiting (OR=1.43, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.12-1.81), exanthema (OR=1.52, 95%CI: 1.19-1.94), and clinical findings including somnolence (OR=1.82, 95%CI: 1.30-2.55), body temperature (OR=1.18 per 1degreeC, 95%CI: 1.05-1.43), and orthostatic hypotension (OR=1.64, 95%CI: 1.13-2.37) increased the probability of DCC as well as a lower platelet count (OR=1.05 per 10,000 platelets/mL reduction, 95%CI: 1.03- 1.06). There was an attenuation of the association between leukocyte count and the probability of DCC during the epidemic as compared to the non-epidemic period (OR=1.26 vs.1.44 per 1,000 cells/mL reduction, p=0.036). The model adequately fit the data with an area under de ROC curve of 0.77 (95%CI: 0.75-0.80). The combination of simple clinical findings and easily accessible hematologic tests could help physicians to discriminate dengue from other febrile illnesses in primary health care settings. These findings might be instrumental to developing a diagnosis algorithm in dengue endemic areas.

N2  - As dengue viruses infect millions of people each year, this disease is considered to be one of the most important infectious diseases in many tropical and subtropical countries. Studies indicate that about 40 % of the world's population lives in countries at risk of dengue infection [1]. Although cyclic, incidences of this disease are increasing and spreading geographically [2]. The dengue virus has been detrimental for the inhabitants of many tropical areas, infecting millions of people worldwide. The dengue epidemic in the Autonomous Region of Madeira, a Portuguese archipelago, was officially declared by the Portuguese Health authorities on October 3rd, 2012. The goals of this study were: (1) to better understand the evolution of the dengue fever in Madeira and (2) to anticipate its trend/intensity for the year of 2013. This study was challenged by the inexistence of past information; because Madeira is experiencing its first dengue epidemic. Thus, past information regarding outbreaks in other countries was obtained to better understand the behavior of the dengue fever itself. Collection criteria were: outbreak information available (year, serotype, duration, frequency, cases, attack rate, urban attack rate); and information related to infant mortality rate, urban population percentage and population density indicators. Therefore, 6 regions of the globe were chosen according to the defined criteria aiming at obtaining similar conditions to Madeira in what would concern the dengue spread like climate, temperature and rainy season. The 6 countries selected were: Cuba, The Bahamas, Guadeloupe, Vietnam (in particular South Vietnam), Australia (in particular Queensland) and Puerto Rico. They all have tropical or sub-tropical climates and their minimum and maximum temperatures do not exceed the interval from 15 to 34 degreeC. The dengue attack rates in Madeira were expected to be approximately from 0.8 to 1.3 % (relative to urban population), for clinical cases, and from around 0.4 % (relative to urban population) to 0.7 %, for confirmed cases. Applying this interval attack rate to the population of 0.27 million living in Madeira Island, and taking into account that 0.19 million is urban population, after studying dengue fever trends in these selected countries in previous decades, it was concluded that, this year (2013), between 2160 and 2470 dengue clinical cases can be expected in Madeira. Up until February 3rd, 2013 there were 2164 diagnosed cases. This analysis is subjective because information about the dengue trend in other countries is being used to anticipate the trend/intensity in Madeira. Each country reacts to an outbreak in a different way. However, taking into account that the goal of this study was not to have exact numbers for this year for dengue cases (2013), but to find some boundaries for them this study fulfills it and feels adequate. In fact, the prediction of the exact number of cases is really improbable; the presentation of a sound estimate is the most useful tool for the Portuguese health institutions' planning and action.

T1  - The financial burden of obesity and type 2 DM; the impact of bariatric surgery in Asia

N2  - The past century has witnessed an almost global, unprecedented improvement in quality of life. his especially so, of healthcare availability and delivery. This is coupled with increasing availability of low cost, energy dense fast foods. Recent data has shown resultant demographic changes and disease trends evolving even in the low income and middle income countries. These changes portend of severe medical, economic and social transformations. Despite persisting levels of undernutrition in some countries in the Asian subcontinent, overweight and obesity have become endemic for almost the entire region. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia and metabolic syndrome are highly prevalent. Asia (China and India) has the largest diabetes burden in the world. The health consequences are devastating in Asian populations due to a strong genetic predisposition to these metabolic diseases. Current lifestyle parameters perhaps accelerate the clinical expression of the disease at a very young age itself. The incidence of childhood obesity and Type2DM in children (earlier unheard of) is also increasing at an alarming pace. Consequent to the exacerbations in these cardiovascular risk factors, half of the world's cardiovascular burden occurs in the Asia-Pacific region. A rapidly increasing, aging and urbanized population and a developing epidemic of chronic diseases will likely overwhelm the health-care systems of less developed countries in the Asia-Pacific. These countries thus nowface a double burden - continued high rates of infectious diseases and rapidly growing Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) prevalence. Globally, 85 % of all people with undiagnosed diabetes are in the lower and middle income countries, where resources are often lacking and governments may not prioritize screening for the condition. Economic burden of an illness can be divided into direct, indirect and abstract costs. In diabetes, treatment of the disease (consultation, investigations, medication, follow up), work days lost, disability payments and loss in quality of life (anxiety, suffering, depression) constitute the direct, indirect and intangible costs incurred respectively. The per capita expenditure on health care in India is only 6.4 per cent of the average world spending, while India accounts for 23.5 per cent of the world's disability adjusted life years lost due to diabetes. The CODE 2 study showed that of the overall cost of diabetes care (type2), ambulatory care accounted for 18 per cent costs, anti-diabetic medications 7 per cent, medications for associated conditions 21 per cent but the bulk of the direct costs (55 %) were due to hospitalizations. The costs were 1.7 times higher in the presence of microvascular disease, with macrovascular disease the cost was twice and when both microand macrovascular disease was present the cost was 3.5 times compared to when no complications were present. The vascular complications of type 2 diabetes account for the majority of the social and economic burden among patients and society more broadly. The WHO recently revised its estimates of the persons with diabetes in India in 2000 to 31.7 million; this number is likely to increase to 79.4 million in 2030.It has been estimated that at the current rate India is likely to spend US$ 336 billion in the treatment of diabetes over the next decade. Its a staggering amount for a growing economy. Health resources in India and other developing countries are very limited with only 5 per cent of GDP, (US$ 23 per capita) being spent on healthcare. The majority of healthcare expenditure is private (4 % of GDP) with only 0.9 per cent of GDP spent on public health care. In developing countries, poverty, inequality, lack of education and the nature of the nutritional transition are root causes of the problem, while limited resourcesmean that NCDsmust compete for political attention and financial investment. Studies from developed western countries and developing countries in Asia have shown similar results regarding the quality of diabetes care and the glycemic outcome among the diabetic population. Less than 30 % of the patients achieve the desired glycemic goals. Bariatric surgery is an established treatment option for morbid obesity. It has also clearly been demonstrated that following bariatric surgery, associated comorbid conditions such as Type2DM are known to resolve completely or improve. There has however been a very gradual increase in awareness of this treatment option being available to the target patient population in most Asian countries, especially India. The acceptance of this treatment option for Type2DM is yet to set in.With nearly 50 % of Type2 diabetics being obese, Bariatric surgery may be cost effective for their treatment as the initial high cost of the surgical procedure is offset over a period of 2-4 years following elimination of medical costs of the resolved comorbidities. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and roux en y gastric bypass are the two popular bariatric procedures performed in India. The LSG has gained significant following due to the technical ease of performing the procedure. However its long term results in terms of metabolic benefits have yet to be proved. The International diabetes federation in 2011 stated that Bariatric surgery was a treatment option for patients with Type2DM and a BMI of>35 kg/m2. That it may be considered a treatment option in patients with uncontrolled diabetes and a BMI between 30-35 Kg/m2. It is also stated that for Asians the limit of BMI be lowered by 2. 5 Kg/m2 due to the strong genetic predisposition. The current status of Obesity and Type2DM is such that urgent measures are required at the preventive level to control their escalation. However for those already diagnosed with these conditions, a retake on the most cost-effective and safe approach for their management is needed. Bariatric surgery may just prove to be the better alternative for patients satisfying the selection criteria.

N2  - Introduction: A subgroup of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD) patients develops symptoms following an episode of infectious gastroenteritis (IGE). Here, we prospectively studied a cohort of subjects exposed to contaminated drinking water and evaluated the risk factors to develop PI-IBS and PI-FD. Method(s): In December 2010, an area with a population of 18.398 was affected by an outbreak of acute infectious gastroenteritis (IGE) following contamination of the drinking water with a mixture of norovirus, Giardia lamblia and Campylobacter jejuni. All inhabitants were requested by mail to complete a survey questionnaire (demographics, ROME-III criteria and bowel habits before, during and after outbreak, psychological profile) within 0-3 months and one year after the outbreak. IGE was defined as onset of self-reported acute gastrointestinal discomfort within 2 weeks after tap water contamination. ROME-III criteria were applied to diagnose the presence of IBS or FD before and one year after the contamination. Children (age ,18 years) and subjects fulfilling ROME III criteria for IBS and FD before the contamination were excluded from analysis. Result(s): In total, 1377 filled out the questionnaires and 1028 subjects were included in the analysis after applying the exclusion criteria. 311 (30%) subjects suffered from IGE. 15.6% of these subjects developed PI-IBS after 1 year compared to 6.5% in the exposed group who did not develop IGE during the outbreak (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.4-1.7; p= 0.001). The degree of tap water exposure was associated with an increased risk to develop IGE, but was not associated with the risk to develop PI-IBS or PI-FD. Severe abdominal cramps and more than 7 days of diarrhea, younger age and increased anxiety/somatization were associated with an increased risk to develop PI-IBS in univariate analysis (p <0.05, table). Inclusion of these parameters in a multivariate logistic regression model identified the duration of diarrhea during IGE (OR 4.8, p=0.023), younger age (OR 0.94, p=0.003) and increased somatization (OR 1.3, p<0.001) as independent risk factors. After one year, FD had developed in 19% of subjects with IGE and in 12% of exposed subjects without IGE (OR 1.8; 95% 1.1-3.1 CI, p=0.030). At univariate analysis younger age and somatization had a significant association with PI-FD (p<0.05, table). Both factors were identified as independent risk factor in the multivariate logistic regression model (age OR 0.91, p=0.002; somatization OR 1.2, p=0.012). Conclusion(s): Our data confirm that an episode of acute gastroenteritis due to contaminated drinking water is associated with an increased risk to develop IBS or FD. Somatization, but not anxiety or depression, and younger age were identified as independent risk factors for both PI-IBS and PI-FD.

N2  - Horizontal transmissions in air-borne pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis , measles, and varicella are difficult to be controlled in hospital settings. M. tuberculosis tends to cause an outbreak amongst in-patients, particularly when the case was recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis in immune-compromised hosts. These pathogens are usually transported in droplet nuclei, and inhaled by breathing. Thus, eradication of droplet nuclei frompatient surrounding environment is essential for prevention of horizontal transmissions in hospitals. There are three major ways of reducing the dose of droplet nuclei from the contaminated air in the patient room. First one is dilution method using hyper ventilation (ACR > 12). It has been widely used in worldwide health care settings e.g. isolation cubicles and examining rooms.The initial cost of this method is relatively cheaper, but running cost could be expensive because of high requirement of electricity. The second one is filtration of contaminated air using high efficiency particulate air filters. Thismethod is also popularly used. Thismethod can be alternative, if portable HEPA unit is available. Unfortunately, the costs of both devices and electricity are expensive. The third method is controlling directions of air flow in the cubicles. This method may enhance the efficacy of reduction in the isolation room under hyper ventilation with cheaper cost. Thismethod however, has not been established as a solo infection control measurement. The risk of horizontal transmission is minimal in most of recognized cases, due to implementation of air-borne precautions in the early stage. The risk must become maximal if the infected patient has not been recognized after he/she became infectious. In fact, the recognition of a recurrent TB case is almost impossible in daily clinical practice, because of the lack of specific signs. Therefore, a novel ventilation technology in common rooms is required to solve this problem. In order to develop a newventilation systemwith sufficient efficiency and cheaper running cost,we investigated the impactof directional air flow and partitions between beds in distribution of droplet nuclei in four bedded roomusing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. We developed a novel technology which can reduce the risk of acquiring TB infections in susceptible patient in the same room. The advantages and disadvantages in other methods are also discussed.

N2  - Synopsis: Agrowing trend is appearing today inmany third world countries; populations of overweight and obese individuals co-existing with wasting and starving populations. As these populations struggle with the ongoing problems of under-nutrition and infectious etiology, they are also burdened with a rapid upsurge of non-communicable disease including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and even premature death. This trend has been paradoxically linked to a steep rise in childhood obesity which the World Health Organization (WHO) has coined the "double burden" effect. Purpose(s): To assess the global epidemic of double burden in children and possible associated complications, biometric measurements were obtained, which included height, weight, body mass index (BMI), arm, and waist circumference, as well as with protocol for the Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run (PACER) and a self-report survey. Method(s): Since 2010, we conducted cross sectional anthropometric and cardiovascular studies on pediatric populations from unique regions of Peru in conjunction with DO Cares' annual medical service elective. At the time of care, parents could choose to consent to their child participating in our anthropometric study. Participants with self-report ages 2-18 were included in study. Subjects were classified by weight status according to growth charts developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) standards. PACER used a random pediatric subpopulation assignment from two local schools of 73 children ages of 10-15 years old; 29 male and 44 female were analyzed. Result(s): According to CDC standards, the percentage of the pediatric population which were overweight and/or obese from 2010-2012 was 36.7% (n = 271). Children aged two to less than five years were the most overweight and obese subpopulation. PACER results according to the fitnessgram found 93.1% of the male children and 29.5% of the female classified as unfit. Overall, the data shows a growing trend toward overweight and obese children. Conclusion(s): The CDC National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2010 reported obesity rates among United States children aged 2-18 years rates to be approximately 17% (or 12.5 million), a rate which corresponded to an adult obesity prevalence estimate of 30.9 %. Our data suggests obesity rates in resource limited countries may be greater than comparable populations of the United States. More alarming is the large prevalence of overweight and obesity among the 2 to = year olds, which could indicate an increasing incidence. PACER results suggest poor cardio-respiratory function and increased disease burden, which appears to impact more male children than female.

N2  - Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are an important source of morbidity and mortality, and represent a major burden on the healthcare system in developed nations. Many of these infections are both avoidable and difficult to treat, fostering interest in interventions to prevent infections from occurring in the first place, rather than relying on new or novel treatment regimens. Hospitals are difficult environments in which to conduct observational research. Patients are not independent from one another, most interventions are not implemented singly but as part of a bundle of efforts to halt outbreaks or reduce endemic rates, and research understandably often takes a secondary role to clinical interventions. Mathematical models of infectious diseases can alleviate some of these problems, allowing for empirical, repeatable research to be conducted in a simulated environment. We used a stochastic compartmental model, simulated using Gillespie's Direct Method to simulate the spread of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in an intensive care unit (ICU). Using parameters obtained from both the literature and infection control surveillance data from the Duke Infection Control Outreach Network (DICON), we consider the model's implications for the growing infection control problem of CDI. The results of the model suggested that increased hand hygiene measures may not be effective in decreasing the transmission of CDI, as transmission can be sustained in the model based only on transient, short-lived contamination, with few healthcare workers having contaminated hands for any substantial periods of time. Additionally, our results indicated that there is a considerable burden within the ICU of patients who, while they might lack the risk factors to develop active CDI infection may be colonized with the organism, providing a source for transmission that is difficult to ascertain or control.

T1  - Prioritisation of arthropod-borne diseases as urgent threats for transmission through substances of human origin in european union

N2  - Background: The risk of transmission of infectious diseases through transfusion or transplantation in the EU is low because effective preventive strategies have been implemented. Nevertheless, many microbial agents, including viruses, bacteria and parasites, can be transmitted through transfusion and transplantation because donors cannot be screened for all known or emerging infectious diseases, and not all substances of human origin (SoHO) can be sterilised or pathogen-inactivated. Aim(s): As the epidemiology and transmission mechanisms of infections are complex, assessing the risk for transmission of infectious diseases to humans through SoHO is not a straightforward process. Risk assessments prepared in advance could facilitate the timely implementation of response activities and control measures, and expedite important decision-making processes with regard to outbreak response and resource allocation. Since various infectious diseases can be transmitted through SoHO, prioritisation is needed to suggest where to best spend resources for risk assessments. To accomplish this goal, those arthropod-borne infectious agents that have an actual or potential risk for transmission through SoHO has to be identified, described and prioritised. Method(s): A prioritisation process has been organized by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and performed in Stockholm during an Expert consultation meeting, attended by 19 participants from eight European countries. Participants were nominated by competent authorities in the Member States, European professional organisations, the Directorate General for Health and Consumers of EU, and ECDC. Experts in SoHO from different backgrounds developed a priority list of arthropod-borne diseases that present an urgent threat to the safety and sustainability of the supply with SoHO in the EU. Diseases were prioritised in two stages: during the first stage, experts determined which of the selected arthropod-borne diseases posed the most urgent threat by using a modified Covey's Time Management matrix which focused on urgency (defined as the possibility of a disease outbreak in the EU) and significance (defined as the likelihood of transmission through SoHO). At the second stage, diseases identified as urgent threats were prioritised according to an impact score that was calculated by multiplying the points given to a particular arthropod-borne disease in relation to the probability of occurrence and the ensuing consequences to human health. Result(s): Results are presented in the table: Diseases not prioritised but subsequently included into the list. Summary/Conclusions: This preliminary priority list will serve as a basis for further analysis of risks posed by arthropod-borne diseases transmission through SoHO. (Table presented).

N2  - Background: The Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands prompted the public health authorities to take measures including ad hoc temporary screening of blood donations for C. burnetii. Risk assessments may allow transfusion regulators to decide when and where the screening should be targeted. The EUFRAT model was developed to support decision making for blood safety during infectious disease outbreaks. Aim(s): To assess the transfusion transmission risks of Q fever during recent outbreaks in the Netherlands. Method(s): Q fever notified cases from selected high incidence areas during period of 1 June 2009 until 31 January 2010 were extracted. Transfusion transmission risks were assessed. The prevalence estimated from the EUFRAT model was compared to the results of an independent blood donation screening study and that using other model developed by Biggerstaff et al. (2003). The EUFRAT model was also used to quantify the risk reduction by implementing additional measures such as blood test and donor deferral. Result(s): We estimated a Q fever prevalence of 288 (95%CI, 159-537) per 100,000 donors and an estimate of 4.39 (95%CI, 0.29-16.86) infected donations out of the 1466 donations. The donation screening study showed in the same area and period three serum samples from 762 donors tested positive for C. burnetii DNA by PCR and by IFA for presence of IgG phase II, resulting in a prevalence of 393.70 per 100,000 donors; this prevalence is in the same order of magnitude with the estimate obtained from the EUFRAT model. The EUFRAT prevalence also showed consistency with result using other model when we used the length of infectivity for the outbreak assessment interval. The prevalence at the outbreak peak in 2007 in the high incidence area was estimated up to fifteen times higher in than the Netherlands in general (132 v 7 per 100,000). At this peak the EUFRAT model estimates the subsequent risks of 0.12 infected donations, 0.36 infected components, 0.21 infected blood products, and 0.21 infections in recipients. Scenario analyses showed that donor deferral for 2 weeks reduced the most infections in recipients, assuming that the infectivity of the pathogen decreased during this deferral period. Conclusion(s): We quantified the transfusion transmission risks of Q fever during various stages of an outbreak using the EUFRAT model. The model can therefore be used in real outbreak situations to support decision making concerning the implementation of additional safety measures.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Hemophilia A is a rare, genetic disorder occurring in males and its treatment involves infusing clotting factor concentrate (FVIII). Currently, the most widely-used FVIII product in China is plasma-derived FVIII. Since plasmaderived FVIII is sourced from local blood donations, it is associated with an increased risk of blood-borne infection. Blood-borne infections can be lifethreatening and have a significant cost on society. The objective of this study was to estimate the extra economic burden associated with a potential bloodborne infection in the hemophilia population of China. METHOD(S): An outbreak of hepatitis C virus (HCV) was used as a real life example of pathogen transmission in the Chinese hemophilia population. Decision tree analysis was adopted to calculate the expected life-time incremental cost associated with treating hemophilia patients infected with HCV. Costs were discounted and sensitivity analyses were conducted to test model sensitivity and assumptions. RESULT(S): Preventing HCV in hemophilia patients is estimated to save an approximately 7 years of life per patient. Expected life-time additional treatment cost (FVIII cost not included) of a hemophilia patient infected with HCV was estimated at 855,341 RMB. Assuming 10% of the registered Chinese hemophilia A patients were affected by HCV, preventing HCV infection in these patients would have saved an estimated 774 million RMB in total. CONCLUSION(S): This research demonstrates the significant potential economic burden of treating hemophilia patients infected with a blood-borne pathogen such as HCV, as well as the value of utilizing a FVIII product that eliminates the transmission risk of another infectious disease similar to the burden associated with HCV.

N2  - Background: Evidence and guidelines suggest that most abscesses do not require antibiotics, and that most cases of cellulitis can be treated without agents effective against CA-MRSA. In 2007, the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) added a record of whether I&D was performed at each ED visit, presenting an opportunity for evaluation of care. Objective(s): Evaluate medical and surgical care of skin infections at US ED visits. Propose quality measures, based on Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines. Evaluate measure adherence, stratifying by region. Method(s): NHAMCS is a four-stage probability sample of all nonfederal US ED visits. Wepooled 2007-2010 data, and flagged all visits using previously published diagnostic codes. We generated national estimates and 95%CIs using appropriately weighted analyses, quantified visit frequencies and proportions, stratified visits by whether I&D was performed or not, and evaluated antibiotic prescribing practices. We developed four potential quality measures: 1) use of antibiotics for discharged I&D patients, 2) use of CA-MRSA-active agents for discharged non-I&D patients, 3) non-use of CA-MRSA-active regimens for I&D patients, and 4) use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole monotherapy for non-I&D patients. Weassessed performance by US region. Result(s): Visit frequencies remained stable over time during the study period. Our data suggest that the CA-MRSA epidemic has affected the South disproportionately (table), with skin infection diagnosed at a higher proportion of visits, and I&D performed at a higher proportion of these. Practices also varied by region, with more aggressive care in the South (table). Use of non-indicated antibiotics was very common, and was more common in the South. Failure to cover CA-MRSA among I&D patients treated with antibiotics was also common, but less so in the South. Conclusion(s): We developed four potential quality measures and found non-adherence to be common for all of them. Abscess patients are frequently treated with antibiotics, patients treated non-surgically are frequently covered for CA-MRSA, CA-MRSA coverage is often omitted in antibiotic treatment of abscess patients, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole monotherapy is common among patients treated nonsurgically. These may represent opportunities for practice improvement and antibiotic stewardship. (Table Presented).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Obesity is epidemic, representing a substantial disease burden. Although obesity is known to increase pregnancy complications, maternal post-operative risks among obese patients that require cesarean delivery are not well characterized. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial to estimate the effect of obesity on post-cesarean complications. The parent study was designed to estimate the effect of supplemental oxygen on post-cesarean infectious morbidity. Since study intervention had no effect, study groups were combined as a cohort. Exposure is obesity, stratified as normal/overweight (BMI <30kg/m2), obese (BMI 30-45 kg/m2) or extremely obese (BMI >45 kg/m2). The primary outcome is a composite of wound infection and endometritis. Secondary outcomes include the composite components and wound opening, hematoma or seroma, and emergency department visit. We performed unadjusted and multinomial logistic regression analyses. Adjusted relative risk ratios (RRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. RESULT(S): 585 women were included in the analysis. Infectious morbidity occurred in 10.4% of all patients. Rates of normal/overweight and obesity class I, II, and III were 25.1%, 30.1%, 14.9% and 29.9% respectively. Eighty-five patients (14.5%) had a BMI >45 kg/m2. Rates of black race, chronic hypertension, diabetes and gestational diabetes increased and operative duration increased with increasing obesity severity. Obese patients were more likely to undergo cesarean after labor and require a vertical skin incision or classical uterine incision. After controlling for relevant confounders, extremely obese patients had a 2-4 fold increase in postoperative complications. CONCLUSION(S): Maternal obesity is associated with a significant increase in post-cesarean wound complications. Risk is concentrated among class III obesity patients with BMI >45 kg/m2. These data can be used to counsel obese patients on operative risks and to target methods to reduce the risk of cesarean in extremely obese patients. (Table Presented).

T1  - Hepatitis C/HIV: How the war on drugs fuels the pandemic
T3  - 3rd International Symposium on Hepatitis Care in Substance Users. Munich Germany.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Hepatitis C is a highly prevalent chronic viral infectionwhich poses major public health, economic and socialcrises, particularly in low and middle income countries.The global hepatitis C epidemic has been described bythe World Health Organization as a"viral time bomb", yetcontinues to receive little attention. Access to preventativeservices is far too low, while diagnosis and treatment areprohibitively expensive and remain inaccessible for most people in need. Public awareness and political will with regard to hepatitis C are also too low, and national hepatitis surveillance is often non-existent. The hepatitis C virus is highly infectious and is easily transmitted through blood-to-blood contact. It thereforedisproportionately impacts upon people who inject drugs: of the 16 million people who inject drugs around theworld, an estimated 10 million are living with hepatitis C. In some of the countries with the harshest drug policies, the majority of people who inject drugs are living with hepatitis C - more than 90 percent in places such as Thailand and parts of the Russian Federation. The hepatitis C virus causes debilitating and fatal disease in around a quarter of those who are chronically infected, and is an increasing cause of premature death among people who inject drugs. Globally, most HIV-infected people who inject drugs are also living with a hepatitis C infection. Harm reduction services - such as the provision of sterile needles and syringes and opioid substitution therapy - can effectively prevent hepatitis C transmission among people who inject drugs, provided they areaccessible and delivered at the required scale. Instead of investing in effective prevention and treatment programmes to achieve the required coverage,governments continue to waste billions of dollars each year on arresting and punishing drug users - a gross misallocation of limited resources that could be more efficiently used for public health and preventive approaches. At the same time, repressive drug policies have fuelled the stigmatisation, discrimination and mass incarceration of people who use drugs. As a result, there are very few countries that have reported significant declines in new infections of hepatitis C among this population. This failure of governments to prevent and control hepatitis disease has great significance for future costs to health and welfare budgets in many countries. In 2012 the Global Commission on Drug Policy released a report that outlined how the"war on drugs" is drivingthe HIV epidemic among people who use drugs. The present report focuses on hepatitis C as it representsanother massive and deadly epidemic for this population. It provides a brief overview of the hepatitis C virus, before exploring how the"war on drugs" and repressive drug policies are failing to drive transmission down. The silence about the harms of repressive drug policies has been broken - they are ineffective, violate basic human rights, generate violence, and expose individuals and communities to unnecessary risks. Hepatitis C is one of these harms - yet it is both preventable and curable when public health is the focus of the drug response. Now is thetime to reform.

N2  - In December of 2008 very virulent infectious bursal disease virus (vvIBDV) was identified in a commercial flock in northern California. Since then several other backyard and commercial facilities in California have had flocks affected by the same strain and other unique (previously unseen) strains of IBDV. Previous to this incident, very virulent infectious bursal disease (vvIBD) had never been identified in North America. Following the initial outbreak in 2008, California became the first state to undertake a voluntary surveillance effort to try to determine the geographical prevalence of vvIBD based on sequencing of a portion of the segment A region of the vvIBDV genome. To date we have complete geographical information on approximately 500 separate accessions representing approximately 1500 birds from over 200 commercial (~85% of the facilities) and backyard facilities (~15% of the facilities) throughout the state. Sequencing of targeted regions of both the segment A and segment B regions of the genome has revealed three distinct types of IBDV in California chickens. One type is genetically and in pathogenically consistent with vvIBDV. The second and third types only have a segment A region consistent with vvIBDV. Geographic information system mapping coupled with spatial-temporal cluster analysis identified significant spatial and time-space clustering; however, no temporal clustering was noted. The lack of temporal clustering coupled with negative vvIBDV results in tested avian wildlife implies that avian wildlife in California do not currently appear to play a significant role in vvIBDV transmission. In the voluntary surveillance that was done in the Central Valley of California, which has a high density of commercial poultry, no positive farms were found when 142 of 504 farms were sampled. Given this level of sampling, the confidence (probability) of detecting an affected commercial flock was calculated to be between 28% and 81% depending on whether one or five hypothetically affected farms were affected. © American Association of Avian Pathologists.

N2  - Detecting outbreaks is a crucial task for public health officials, yet gaps remain in the systematic evaluation of outbreak detection protocols. The authors' objectives were to design, implement, and test a flexible methodology for generating detailed synthetic surveillance data that provides realistic geographical and temporal clustering of cases and use to evaluate outbreak detection protocols. A detailed representation of the Boston area was constructed, based on data about individuals, locations, and activity patterns. Influenza-like illness (ILI) transmission was simulated, producing 100 years of in silico ILI data. Six different surveillance systems were designed and developed using gathered cases from the simulated disease data. Performance was measured by inserting test outbreaks into the surveillance streams and analyzing the likelihood and timeliness of detection. Detection of outbreaks varied from 21% to 95%. Increased coverage did not linearly improve detection probability for all surveillance systems. Relaxing the decision threshold for signaling outbreaks greatly increased false-positives, improved outbreak detection slightly, and led to earlier outbreak detection. Geographical distribution can be more important than coverage level. Detailed simulations of infectious disease transmission can be configured to represent nearly any conceivable scenario. They are a powerful tool for evaluating the performance of surveillance systems and methods used for outbreak detection.

N2  - Changes in host diversity have been postulated to influence the risk of infectious diseases, including both dilution and amplification effects. The dilution effect refers to a negative relationship between biodiversity and disease risk, whereas the amplification effect occurs when biodiversity increases disease risk. We tested these effects with an influential disease, bovine tuberculosis (BTB), which is widespread in many countries, causing severe economic losses. Based on the BTB outbreak data in cattle from 2005 to 2010, we also tested, using generalized linear mixed models, which other factors were associated with the regional BTB presence in cattle in Africa. The interdependencies of predictors and their correlations with BTB presence were examined using path analysis. Our results suggested a dilution effect, where increased mammal species richness was associated with reduced probability of BTB presence after adjustment for cattle density. In addition, our results also suggested that areas with BTB infection in the preceding year, higher cattle density and larger percentage of area occupied by African buffalo were more likely to report BTB outbreaks. Climatic variables only indirectly influenced the risk of BTB presence through their effects on cattle density and wildlife distribution. Since most studies investigating the role of wildlife species on BTB transmission only involve single-species analysis, more efforts are needed to better understand the effect of the structure of wildlife communities on BTB dynamics.

N2  - Contingency planning for potential equine infectious disease outbreaks relies on accurate information on horse location and movements to estimate the risk of dissemination of disease(s). An online questionnaire was used to obtain unique information linking owner and horse location to characteristics of horse movements within and outwith Great Britain (GB). This online survey yielded a strong response, providing more than four times the target number of respondents (1000 target respondents) living in all parts of GB. Key demographic findings of this study indicated that horses which were kept on livery yards and riding schools were likely to be found in urban environments, some distance away from the owner's home and vaccinated against influenza and herpes virus. Survey respondents were likely to travel greater than 10 miles to attend activities such as eventing or endurance but were also likely to travel and return home within a single day (58.6%, 2063/3522). This may affect the geographical extent and speed of disease spread, if large numbers of people from disparate parts of the country are attending the same event and the disease agent is highly infectious or virulent. The greatest risk for disease introduction and spread may be represented by a small proportion of people who import or travel internationally with their horses. These respondents were likely to have foreign horse passports, which were not necessarily recorded in the National Equine Database (NED), making the location of these horses untraceable. These results illustrate the difficulties which exist with national GB horse traceability despite the existence of the NED and the horse passport system. This study also demonstrates that an online approach could be adopted to obtain important demographic data on GB horse owners on a more routine and frequent basis to inform decisions or policy pertaining to equine disease control. This represents a reasonable alternative to collection of GB horse location and movement data given that the NED no longer exists and there is no immediate plan to replace it.

T1  - Stochastic analysis of epidemics on adaptive time varying networks
A1  - Kotnis B.
A1  - Kuri J. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Many studies investigating the effect of human social connectivity structures (networks) and human behavioral adaptations on the spread of infectious diseases have assumed either a static connectivity structure or a network which adapts itself in response to the epidemic (adaptive networks). However, human social connections are inherently dynamic or time varying. Furthermore, the spread of many infectious diseases occur on a time scale comparable to the time scale of the evolving network structure. Here we aim to quantify the effect of human behavioral adaptations on the spread of asymptomatic infectious diseases on time varying networks. We perform a full stochastic analysis using a continuous time Markov chain approach for calculating the outbreak probability, mean epidemic duration, epidemic reemergence probability, etc. Additionally, we use mean-field theory for calculating epidemic thresholds. Theoretical predictions are verified using extensive simulations. Our studies have uncovered the existence of an "adaptive threshold," i.e., when the ratio of susceptibility (or infectivity) rate to recovery rate is below the threshold value, adaptive behavior can prevent the epidemic. However, if it is above the threshold, no amount of behavioral adaptations can prevent the epidemic. Our analyses suggest that the interaction patterns of the infected population play a major role in sustaining the epidemic. Our results have implications on epidemic containment policies, as awareness campaigns and human behavioral responses can be effective only if the interaction levels of the infected populace are kept in check.

N2  - The development of early warning systems is fundamental for preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Data collection, however, is a costly activity and it is not possible to implement early warning systems everywhere and for all possible events. Hence, tools helping to improve the focus of surveillance efforts are of paramount importance. Risk assessment methods and other provisional modelling techniques may permit to estimate the probability of introduction and spread of infectious diseases in different geographical areas. Similarly, efficient information systems must be in place to assist the veterinary services in case of epidemic emergencies in order to support the prompt application of control measures for the containment of the infection and the reduction of the magnitude of negative consequences. This review describes two recent approaches to the estimation of the probability of introduction and spread of infectious diseases based on the use of risk maps/spatial modelling and Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques. The review also describes a web application developed in Italy to help official veterinary services to trace animals in case of outbreaks of infectious diseases.

N2  - Exclusion of children with presumptive Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) from childcare facilities until negative stool specimens are obtained is routine practice that disrupts families. We estimated the shedding and exclusion duration and transmission risk in such facilities. The study population comprised 225 children aged <6 years attending 201 childcare facilities in England with microbiologically confirmed VTEC in 2010-2011. We estimated the interval from onset to first negative specimen, and identified transmission events with secondary cases linked to facilities. The median duration of shedding was 31 days, and median period of exclusion was 39.5 days. Cases attending facilities while shedding VTEC did so for a median of 2 days before exclusion. Secondary cases occurred in 6/83 facilities (7%) attended by infectious cases. Despite evidence of VTEC shedding at facilities, transmission is relatively low. Revised control guidelines could consider supervised return for prolonged asymptomatic shedders.Copyright © 2013 Cambridge University Press.

T1  - Selecting nonpharmaceutical interventions for influenza
A1  - Jones R.M.
A1  - Adida E. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Models of influenza transmission have focused on the ability of vaccination, antiviral therapy, and social distancing strategies to mitigate epidemics. Influenza transmission, however, may also be interrupted by hygiene interventions such as frequent hand washing and wearing masks or respirators. We apply a model of influenza disease transmission that incorporates hygiene and social distancing interventions. The model describes population mixing as a Poisson process, and the probability of infection upon contact between an infectious and susceptible person is parameterized by p. While social distancing interventions modify contact rates in the population, hygiene interventions modify p. Public health decision making involves tradeoffs, and we introduce an objective function that considers the direct costs of interventions and new infections to determine the optimum intervention type (social distancing versus hygiene intervention) and population compliance for epidemic mitigation. Significant simplifications have been made in these models. However, we demonstrate that the method is feasible, provides plausible results, and is sensitive to the selection of model parameters. Specifically, we show that the optimum combination of nonpharmaceutical interventions depends upon the probability of infection, intervention compliance, and duration of infectiousness. Means by which realism can be increased in the method are discussed. © 2012 Society for Risk Analysis.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - An approach to increase effectiveness of epidemiological control of Crimean hemorrhagic fever, West Nile fever and Astrakhan spotted fever by building a prognostic model of epidemic activity based on contemporary information technologies of spatial and intellectual data analysis was developed and tested. Personified data on 4505 laboratory confirmed cases of natural-focal infectious diseases registered in the Russian Federation and database on 1999 - 2011 climatic observations were processed. A model implementing prognosis of epidemiological situation intensity level as a function of a combination of factors, maps of density of epidemic manifestations were built. On a practical example high effectiveness of the approach to epidemiological analysis based on the use of contemporary analytical technologies for evaluation of temporal and spatial categories of epidemiological risk was demonstrated.

T1  - Eliminating infectious diseases of livestock: A metapopulation model of infection control
A1  - Glass K.
A1  - Barnes B. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - When novel disease outbreaks occur in livestock, policy makers must respond promptly to eliminate disease, and are typically called on to make control decisions before detailed analysis of disease parameters can be undertaken. We present a flexible metapopulation model of disease spread that incorporates variation in livestock density and includes occasional high-mixing locations or events, such as markets or race meetings. Using probability generating functions derived from this branching process model, we compare the likely success of reactive control strategies in eliminating disease spread. We find that the optimal vaccine strategy varies according to the disease transmission rate, with homogeneous vaccination most effective for low transmission rates, and heterogeneous vaccination preferable for high levels of transmission. Quarantine combines well with vaccination, with the chance of disease elimination enhanced even for vaccines with low efficacy. Control decisions surrounding horse race meetings were of particular concern during the 2007 outbreak of equine influenza in Australia. We show that this type of high-mixing event is a powerful spread mechanism, even when the proportion of time spent at such events is low. If such locations remain open, elimination will require a highly effective vaccine with high coverage. However, a policy of banning animals from quarantined regions from attending such events can provide an effective alternative if full closure of events is economically or politically untenable. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - The effect of population heterogeneities upon spread of infection
A1  - Clancy D.
A1  - Pearce C.J. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - It has often been observed that population heterogeneities can lead to outbreaks of infection being less frequent and less severe than homogeneous population models would suggest. We address this issue by comparing a model incorporating various forms of heterogeneity with a homogenised model matched according to the value of the basic reproduction number R0. We mainly focus upon heterogeneity in individuals' infectivity and susceptibility, though with some allowance also for heterogeneous patterns of mixing. The measures of infectious spread we consider are (i) the probability of a major outbreak; (ii) the mean outbreak size; (iii) the mean endemic prevalence level; and (iv) the persistence time. For each measure, we establish conditions under which heterogeneity leads to a reduction in infectious spread. We also demonstrate that if such conditions are not satisfied, the reverse may occur. As well as comparison with a homogeneous population, we investigate comparisons between two heterogeneous populations of differing degrees of heterogeneity. All of our results are derived under the assumption that the susceptible population is sufficiently large. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

T1  - Climate change threats to population health and well-being: the imperative of protective solutions that will last
A1  - Kjellstrom T.
A1  - McMichael A.J. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - The observational evidence of the impacts of climate conditions on human health is accumulating. A variety of direct, indirect, and systemically mediated health effects have been identified. Excessive daily heat exposures create direct effects, such as heat stroke (and possibly death), reduce work productivity, and interfere with daily household activities. Extreme weather events, including storms, floods, and droughts, create direct injury risks and follow-on outbreaks of infectious diseases, lack of nutrition, and mental stress. Climate change will increase these direct health effects. Indirect effects include malnutrition and under-nutrition due to failing local agriculture, spread of vector-borne diseases and other infectious diseases, and mental health and other problems caused by forced migration from affected homes and workplaces. Examples of systemically mediated impacts on population health include famine, conflicts, and the consequences of large-scale adverse economic effects due to reduced human and environmental productivity. This article highlights links between climate change and non-communicable health problems, a major concern for global health beyond 2015. Detailed regional analysis of climate conditions clearly shows increasing temperatures in many parts of the world. Climate modelling indicates that by the year 2100 the global average temperature may have increased by 34degreeC unless fundamental reductions in current global trends for greenhouse gas emissions are achieved. Given other unforeseeable environmental, social, demographic, and geopolitical changes that may occur in a plus-4-degree world, that scenario may comprise a largely uninhabitable world for millions of people and great social and military tensions. It is imperative that we identify actions and strategies that are effective in reducing these increasingly likely threats to health and well-being. The fundamental preventive strategy is, of course, climate change mitigation by significantly reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, especially long-acting carbon dioxide (CO(2)), and by increasing the uptake of CO(2) at the earth's surface. This involves urgent shifts in energy production from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, energy conservation in building design and urban planning, and reduced waste of energy for transport, building heating/cooling, and agriculture. It would also involve shifts in agricultural production and food systems to reduce energy and water use particularly in meat production. There is also potential for prevention via mitigation, adaptation, or resilience building actions, but for the large populations in tropical countries, mitigation of climate change is required to achieve health protection solutions that will last.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - The ability of a pathogen to cause an epidemic when introduced in a new host population often relies on its ability to adapt to this new environment. Here, we give a brief overview of recent theoretical and empirical studies of such evolutionary emergence of pathogens. We discuss the effects of several ecological and genetic factors that may affect the likelihood of emergence: migration, life history of the infectious agent, host heterogeneity, and the rate and effects of mutations. We contrast different modelling approaches and indicate how details in the way we model each step of a life cycle can have important consequences on the predicted probability of evolutionary emergence. These different theoretical perspectives yield important insights into optimal surveillance and intervention strategies, which should aim for a reduction in the emergence (and re-emergence) of infectious diseases.

T1  - Risk mapping of heart and skeletal muscle inflammation in salmon farming
A1  - Kristoffersen A.B.
A1  - Bang Jensen B.
A1  - Jansen P.A. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) is an infectious disease causing losses to the Norwegian salmon farming industry due to increased mortality and high morbidity in infected salmon. The disease is listed as a notifiable disease on list 3 (national list) by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority. HSMI is believed to be a viral disease, but the association to the recently discovered Piscine reovirus (PRV) remains unclear. Undoubtedly, other factors interact to determine whether PRV-infected fish develop disease or not.In this study, logistic regression was used to model the risk of an outbreak of HSMI at the cohort level, by including spatio-temporal risk factors. The data consisted of fish cohorts grown on geo-referenced farms from 2002 to 2010. The risk factors included were: infection pressure, cohort size (maximum number of fish), cohort index (smolt characteristics), cohort lifespan (months in sea) and a geo-index calculated as the position along a local polynomial regression line based on the longitude and latitude of each farm included in the study.The results showed that the risk of developing HSMI increased with increasing cohort lifespan, increasing infection pressure and increasing cohort size, and was mostly low for cohorts grown on farms in Southern-Norway, high for farms in Mid-Norway and variable for farms in Northern-Norway (based on the geo-index). The final model was used to explore three different scenarios with regards to the risk of developing HSMI, and to calculate the probability for each cohort of developing HSMI, independent of their actual disease-status.The model suggested that the probability of developing HSMI was much higher in Mid-Norway than in the rest of the country. Even though PRV seems to be widely distributed in the environment, the finding that infection pressure has a large influence on the probability of developing HSMI, suggests that it might be possible to reduce the number of clinical outbreaks, if measures are taken to reduce infection pressure. However, the prospects of controlling the spread of HSMI and reducing clinical outbreaks might be difficult because of indications of large distance spread of the disease. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

T1  - Too much of a good thing? When to stop catch-up vaccination
A1  - Hutton D.W.
A1  - Brandeau M.L. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - During the 20th century, deaths from a range of serious infectious diseases decreased dramatically due to the development of safe and effective vaccines. However, infant immunization coverage has increased only marginally since the 1960s, and many people remain susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases. "Catch-up vaccination" for age groups beyond infancy can be an attractive and effective means of immunizing people who were missed earlier. However, as newborn vaccination rates increase, catch-up vaccination becomes less attractive: the number of susceptible people decreases, so the cost to find and vaccinate each unvaccinated person may increase; in addition, the number of infected individuals decreases, so each unvaccinated person faces a lower risk of infection. This article presents a general framework for determining the optimal time to discontinue a catch-up vaccination program. We use a cost-effectiveness framework: we consider the cost per quality-adjusted life year gained of catch-up vaccination efforts as a function of newborn immunization rates over time and consequent disease prevalence and incidence. We illustrate our results with the example of hepatitis B catch-up vaccination in China. We contrast results from a dynamic modeling approach with an approach that ignores the impact of vaccination on future disease incidence. The latter approach is likely to be simpler for decision makers to understand and implement because of lower data requirements.

N2  - Infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) caused a large epidemic in farmed Atlantic salmon in Chile in 2007-2009. Here, we assessed co-infection patterns of ISAV and sea lice (SL) based on surveillance data collected by the fish health authority. ISAV status and SL counts in all Atlantic salmon farms located in the 10th region of Chile were registered monthly from July 2007 through December 2009. Each farm was categorized monthly according to its ISAV and SL status. A multinomial time-space scan test using a circular window was applied to identify disease clusters, and a multivariate regression model was fitted to quantify the association between disease-clustering and farm-management factors. Most of the identified clusters (9/13) were associated with high SL burdens. There were significant associations (P < 0.05) between management factors and ISAV/SL status. Areas in which good management practices were associated with a reduced disease risk were identified. The findings of this study suggest that certain management practices can effectively reduce the risk of SL and ISAV in the face of an epidemic and will be helpful towards creating an effective disease control programme in Chile. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

T1  - Risk factor analysis may provide clues to diarrhea prevention in outdoor-housed rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta)

N2  - Seventy-five percent of rhesus macaques at national primate research centers are housed outside. Annually, 15-39% of these animals experience diarrhea and require veterinary treatment for dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or weight loss. An estimated 21-33% of these patients will die or be euthanized. Many studies have explored the various infectious etiologies of non-human primate diarrhea. However, there is little published information on diarrhea incidence rates and risk factors in outdoor-housed rhesus macaques. Without this information, it is challenging to determine endemic and epidemic diarrhea levels, or to develop and evaluate mitigation strategies. Using electronic medical records, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to calculate diarrhea incidence rates for rhesus macaques (N=3,181) housed in three different outdoor housing types (corrals, shelters, and temporary housing) at the Oregon National Primate Research Center between November 1, 2009 and October 31, 2010. With multiple logistic regression analysis, we determined the relative risk of housing type, sex, and age on development of diarrhea. Diarrhea incidence and mortality in our population was lower than many published ranges. Type of outdoor housing, age, and previous diarrhea episode were positively correlated with diarrhea risk. Younger animals in smaller shelters and temporary housing had a greater risk of acquiring diarrhea, with juvenile animals (0.7-3.9 years) having the highest mortality rate. Sex was not a risk factor, but adult females with diarrhea were more likely to develop life-threatening complications than adult males. We also constructed a predictive model for diarrhea-associated mortality using Classification and Regression Tree. Findings from this study will be used to develop and evaluate mitigation strategies in our outdoor-housed population and to provide a foundation for genetic susceptibility and immune function testing. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - W.O. Kermack and A.G. McKendrick introduced in their fundamental paper, A Contribution to the Mathematical Theory of Epidemics, published in 1927, a deterministic model that captured the qualitative dynamic behavior of single infectious disease outbreaks. A Kermack-McKendrick discrete-time general framework, motivated by the emergence of a multitude of models used to forecast the dynamics of epidemics, is introduced in this manuscript. Results that allow us to measure quantitatively the role of classical and general distributions on disease dynamics are presented. The case of the geometric distribution is used to evaluate the impact of waiting-time distributions on epidemiological processes or public health interventions. In short, the geometric distribution is used to set up the baseline or null epidemiological model used to test the relevance of realistic stage-period distribution on the dynamics of single epidemic outbreaks. A final size relationship involving the control reproduction number, a function of transmission parameters and the means of distributions used to model disease or intervention control measures, is computed. Model results and simulations highlight the inconsistencies in forecasting that emerge from the use of specific parametric distributions. Examples, using the geometric, Poisson and binomial distributions, are used to highlight the impact of the choices made in quantifying the risk posed by single outbreaks and the relative importance of various control measures. © 2013 Society for Mathematical Biology.

T1  - Games of age-dependent prevention of chronic infections by social distancing
A1  - Reluga T.C.
A1  - Li J. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Epidemiological games combine epidemic modelling with game theory to assess strategic choices in response to risks from infectious diseases. In most epidemiological games studied thus-far, the strategies of an individual are represented with a single choice parameter. There are many natural situations where strategies can not be represented by a single dimension, including situations where individuals can change their behavior as they age. To better understand how age-dependent variations in behavior can help individuals deal with infection risks, we study an epidemiological game in an SI model with two life-history stages where social distancing behaviors that reduce exposure rates are age-dependent. When considering a special case of the general model, we show that there is a unique Nash equilibrium when the infection pressure is a monotone function of aggregate exposure rates, but non-monotone effects can appear even in our special case. The non-monotone effects sometimes result in three Nash equilibria, two of which have local invasion potential simultaneously. Returning to a general case, we also describe a game with continuous age-structure using partial-differential equations, numerically identify some Nash equilibria, and conjecture about uniqueness. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) has a worldwide distribution. This economically important endemic disease causes reproductive failure in breeding stock and respiratory tract illness in young pigs. In Ontario restricted fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) 1-18-4 has been determined as one of the most common virus genotypes. Individual-level models (ILMs) for infectious diseases, fitted in a Bayesian MCMC framework, have been used to describe both the spatial and temporal spread of diseases. They are an intuitive and flexible class of models that can take into account population heterogeneity via various individual-level covariates. The objective of this study is to identify relative importance of risk factors for the spread of the genotype 1-18-4 from monitoring data in southern Ontario using ILMs. Specifically, we explore networks through which resources are obtained or delivered, as well as the ownership structure of herds, and identify factors that may be contributing to high risk of infection.A population of 316 herds which experienced their PRRS outbreaks between September 2004 and August 2007 are included in the analyses, in which 194 (61%) are sow herds. During the study period, 45 herds (27 sow herds) experienced their first outbreak due to RFLP 1-18-4. Our results show that the three relatively most important factors for the spread of 1-18-4 genotype in Ontario swine herds were sharing the same herd ownership, gilt source and market trucks. All other networks had relatively smaller impact on spread of this PRRSV genotype. Spatial proximity could not be identified as important contributor to spread. Our findings also suggest that gilt acclimation should be practiced whenever possible and appropriate to reduce the risk for the herd and for others as it is already widely implemented and recommended in the North American swine industry. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Reasons for performing the study: The National Equine Database (NED) contains information on the size and distribution of the horse population, but the data quality remains unknown. These data could assist with surveillance, research and contingency planning for equine infectious disease outbreaks. Objective(s): 1) To assess the extent of obsolete and missing data from NED, 2) evaluate the extent of spatial separation between horse and owner location and 3) identify relationships between spatial separation and land use. Method(s): Two questionnaires were used to assess data accuracy in NED utilising local authority passport inspections and distribution of questionnaires to 11,000 horse owners. A subset of 1010 questionnaires was used to assess horse-owner geographic separation. Result(s): During 2005-2010, 17,048 passports were checked through local authority inspections. Of these, 1558 passports (9.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.7-9.5%) were noncompliant, with 963 (5.6%; 95% CI 5.3-6.0%) containing inaccurate information and 595 (3.5%; 95% CI 3.2-3.8%) classified as missing. Of 1382 questionnaires completed by horse owners, 380 passports were obsolete (27.5%; 95% CI 25.2-29.9%), with 162 (11.7%; 95% CI 10.0-13.4%) being retained for deceased horses and 218 (15.8%; 95% CI 13.9-17.7%) having incorrect ownership details. Fifty-three per cent (95% CI 49.9-56.1%) of owners kept their horse(s) at home and 92% (95% CI 90.3-93.7%) of horses resided within 10km of their owners. Conclusions and potential relevance: Data from a small sample survey suggest the majority of data on NED are accurate but a proportion of inaccuracies exist that may cause delay in locating horses and contacting owners during a disease outbreak. The probability that horses are located in the same postcode sector as the owner's home address is larger in rural areas. Appropriate adjustment for population size, horse-owner spatial separation and land usage would facilitate meaningful use of the national horse population derived from NED for risk modelling of incursions of equine diseases into Great Britain. © 2012 EVJ Ltd.

N2  - In 2006, Bluetongue serotype 8 was notified for the first time in north-western Europe, more specifically in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemburg, Germany and France. The disease spread very rapidly, affecting mainly cattle and sheep farms. In this paper, we examined risk factors affecting the spatial incidence of reported Bluetongue events during the first outbreak in 2006. Previous studies suggested that the Bluetongue incidence was enhanced by environmental factors, such as temperature and wind speed and direction, as well as by human interventions, such as the transport of animals. In contrast to the previous studies, which were based on univariable analyses, a multivariable epidemiological analysis describing the spatial relationship between Bluetongue incidence and possible risk factors is proposed in this paper. This disentangles the complex interplay between different risk factors.Our model shows that wind is the most important factor affecting the incidence of the disease. In addition, areas with high precipitation are slightly more sensitive to the spread of the infection via the wind. Another important risk factor is the land cover; high-risk areas for infection being characterized by a fragmentation of the land cover, especially the combination of forests and urban areas. Precipitation and temperature are also significant risk factors. High precipitation in areas with a large coverage of forests and/or pasture increases the risk whereas high temperature increases the risk considerably in municipalities covered mainly with pasture. Local spread via the vector is strongest in areas with a large coverage of forests and smallest in highly urbanized areas. Finally, the transport of animals from infected areas is a risk factor. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Using Population Viability Criteria to Assess Strategies to Minimize Disease Threats for an Endangered Carnivore

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Outbreaks of infectious disease represent serious threats to the viability of many vertebrate populations, but few studies have included quantitative evaluations of alternative approaches to the management of disease. The most prevalent management approach is monitoring for and rapid response to an epizootic. An alternative is vaccination of a subset of the free-living population (i.e., a "vaccinated core") such that some individuals are partially or fully immune in the event of an epizootic. We developed a simulation model describing epizootic dynamics, which we then embedded in a demographic simulation to assess these alternative approaches to managing rabies epizootics in the island fox (Urocyon littoralis), a species composed of only 6 small populations on the California Channel Islands. Although the monitor and respond approach was superior to the vaccinated-core approach for some transmission models and parameter values, this type of reactive management did not protect the population from rabies under many disease-transmission assumptions. In contrast, a logistically feasible program of prophylactic vaccination for part of the wild population yielded low extinction probabilities across all likely disease-transmission scenarios, even with recurrent disease introductions. Our use of a single metric of successful management-probability of extreme endangerment (i.e., quasi extinction)-to compare very different management approaches allowed an objective assessment of alternative strategies for controlling the threats posed by infectious disease outbreaks. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.

N2  - Changes in host diversity have been postulated to influence the risk of infectious diseases, including both dilution and amplification effects. The dilution effect refers to a negative relationship between biodiversity and disease risk, whereas the amplification effect occurs when biodiversity increases disease risk. We tested these effects with an influential disease, bovine tuberculosis (BTB), which is widespread in many countries, causing severe economic losses. Based on the BTB outbreak data in cattle from 2005 to 2010, we also tested, using generalized linear mixed models, which other factors were associated with the regional BTB presence in cattle in Africa. The interdependencies of predictors and their correlations with BTB presence were examined using path analysis. Our results suggested a dilution effect, where increased mammal species richness was associated with reduced probability of BTB presence after adjustment for cattle density. In addition, our results also suggested that areas with BTB infection in the preceding year, higher cattle density and larger percentage of area occupied by African buffalo were more likely to report BTB outbreaks. Climatic variables only indirectly influenced the risk of BTB presence through their effects on cattle density and wildlife distribution. Since most studies investigating the role of wildlife species on BTB transmission only involve single-species analysis, more efforts are needed to better understand the effect of the structure of wildlife communities on BTB dynamics.

N2  - Heterogeneity in host association patterns can alter pathogen transmission and strategies for control. Great apes are highly social and endangered animals that have experienced substantial population declines from directly transmitted pathogens; as such, network approaches to quantify contact heterogeneity could be crucially important for predicting infection probability and outbreak size following pathogen introduction, especially owing to challenges in collecting real-time infection data for endangered wildlife. We present here the first study using network analysis to quantify contact heterogeneity in wild apes, with applications for predicting community-wide infectious disease risk. Specifically, within a wild chimpanzee community, we ask how associations between individuals vary over time, and we identify traits of highly connected individuals that might contribute disproportionately to pathogen spread. We used field observations of behavioural encounters in a habituated wild chimpanzee community in Kibale National Park, Uganda to construct monthly party level (i.e. subgroup) and close-contact (i.e. <=5 m) association networks over a 9-month period. Network analysis revealed that networks were highly dynamic over time. In particular, oestrous events significantly increased pairwise party associations, suggesting that community-wide disease outbreaks should be more likely to occur when many females are in oestrus. Bayesian models and permutation tests identified traits of chimpanzees that were highly connected within the network. Individuals with large families (i.e. mothers and their juveniles) that range in the core of the community territory and to a lesser extent high-ranking males were central to association networks, and thus represent the most important individuals to target for disease intervention strategies. Overall, we show striking temporal variation in network structure and traits that predict association patterns in a wild chimpanzee community. These empirically-derived networks can inform dynamic models of pathogen transmission and have practical applications for infectious disease management of endangered wildlife species. © 2013 British Ecological Society.

N2  - Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a severe viral disease of cattle. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the virus is transmitted mechanically by blood-feeding arthropods. We compared the importance of transmission via direct and indirect contact in field conditions by using mathematical tools. We analyzed a dataset collected during the LSD outbreak in 2006 in a large dairy herd, which included ten separated cattle groups. Outbreak dynamics and risk factors for LSD were assessed by a transmission model. Transmission by three contact modes was modelled; indirect contact between the groups within a herd, direct contact or contact via common drinking water within the groups and transmission by contact during milking procedure. Indirect transmission was the only parameter that could solely explain the entire outbreak dynamics and was estimated to have an overall effect that was over 5 times larger than all other possible routes of transmission, combined. The R0 value induced by indirect transmission per the presence of an infectious cow for 1 day in the herd was 15.7, while the R0 induced by direct transmission was 0.36. Sensitivity analysis showed that this result is robust to a wide range of assumptions regarding mean and standard deviation of incubation period and regarding the existence of sub-clinically infected cattle. These results indicate that LSD virus spread within the affected herd could hardly be attributed to direct contact between cattle or contact through the milking procedure. It is therefore concluded that transmission mostly occurs by indirect contact, probably by flying, blood-sucking insects. This has important implications for control of LSD.

T1  - Infectious Co-Factors in HIV-1 transmission herpes simplex virus type-2 and HIV-1: New insights and interventions
A1  - Barnabas R.V.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Over the last thirty years, epidemiologic and molecular studies indicate a strong and synergist relationship between the dual epidemics of herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) and HIV-1 infection. While prospective studies show that HSV-2 infection increases the risk for HIV-1 acquisition by 2- to 3-fold, HSV-2 suppression with standard prophylactic doses of HSV-2 therapy did not prevent HIV-1 acquisition. Reconciling these discrepancies requires understanding recent HSV-2 pathogenesis research, which indicates HSV-2 infection is not a latent infection with infrequent recurrence but a near constant state of reactivation and viral shedding which is not completely suppressed by standard antivirals. Because current antivirals do not prevent or fully suppress HSV-2 replication, priorities are HSV-2 vaccine development and antivirals that reach high concentrations in the genital mucosa and suppress the persistent genital inflammation associated with genital herpes reactivation in order to reduce the increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection associated with HSV-2. HIV-1 and HSV-2 synergy is also seen among co-infected individuals who exhibit higher HIV-1 viral load compared to HSV-2 uninfected individuals. Standard HSV-2 therapy modestly lowers HIV-1 viral load and is associated with slower HIV-1 disease progression. A promising area of research is higher doses of HSV-2 suppressive therapy achieving a greater reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA, which could translate to greater reductions in HIV-1 disease progression and infectiousness. However, many questions remain to be answered including potential effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of higher dose HSV-2 suppressive therapy. Mathematical models of HSV-2 and HIV-1 at a population level would be useful tools to estimate the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of higher dose HSV-2 suppressive therapy. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  - Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) are a highly threatened species because of habitat loss, human conflict, and high prevalence of disease in captivity. An epidemic of feline infectious peritonitis and concern for spread of infectious disease resulted in decreased movement of cheetahs between U.S. zoological facilities for managed captive breeding. Identifying the true feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection status of cheetahs is challenging because of inconsistent correlation between seropositivity and fecal viral shedding. Because the pattern of fecal shedding of FCoV is unknown in cheetahs, this study aimed to assess the frequency of detectable fecal viral shedding in a 30-day period and to determine the most efficient fecal sampling strategy to identify cheetahs shedding FCoV. Fecal samples were collected from 16 cheetahs housed at seven zoological facilities for 30 to 46 consecutive days; the samples were evaluated for the presence of FCoV by reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR). Forty-four percent (7/16) of cheetahs had detectable FCoV in feces, and the proportion of positive samples for individual animals ranged from 13 to 93%. Cheetahs shed virus persistently, intermittently, or rarely over 30-46 days. Fecal RT-nPCR results were used to calculate the probability of correctly identifying a cheetah known to shed virus given multiple hypothetical fecal collection schedules. The most efficient hypothetical fecal sample collection schedule was evaluation of five individual consecutive fecal samples, resulting in a 90% probability of identifying a known shedder. Demographic and management risk factors were not significantly associated (P <= 0.05) with fecal viral shedding. Because some cheetahs shed virus intermittently to rarely, fecal sampling schedules meant to identify all known shedders would be impractical with current tests and eradication of virus from the population unreasonable. Managing the captive population as endemically infected with FCoV may be a more feasible approach. © 2012 American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

N2  - The literature shows ample evidence of stigmatization of mental illness and infectious diseases. Although cancer does not fall under any of the above categories, it has been stigmatized because of the deleterious consequences of its course and treatment. In fact, in the 21st century, cancer remains a dreaded disease associated with social representations of death, impairment, disfigurement, suffering, and pain. The objectives of this paper are twofold: first, to review theoretical elements that can help understand the stigma associated with physical illness, by defining the concept of stigma, presenting the different theoretical models of stigmatization of physical illness, and describing the psychosocial functions of stigma for both the stigmatized and stigmatizing individuals. Second, to focus on the specificity of cancer-related stigma, with particular reference to the cultural aspects of coping strategies used by oncological patients to address illness and the related stigma, through practices based on popular medicine. As part of the conclusion, it is suggested that cancer-related stigma has undergone several changes during history, from being a fatal disease to being a chronic disease. However, its initially silent course, alarming epidemic behaviour (still uncontrollable despite scientific advances), and treatment characteristics favour negative social representations of cancer (as conviction, sentence of death, suffering, deterioration, pain, affliction, and guilt), which act as iatrogenic factors in the health-disease process, interfering especially in the decision making regarding effective treatments and leading patients to prefer alternative methods based on popular medicine, even if those methods imply risks for their health and quality of life.Copyright © Springer-Verlag France 2012.

N2  - Climate warming over the next century is expected to have a large impact on the interactions between pathogens and their animal and human hosts. Vector-borne diseases are particularly sensitive to warming because temperature changes can alter vector development rates, shift their geographical distribution and alter transmission dynamics. For this reason, African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), a vector-borne disease of humans and animals, was recently identified as one of the 12 infectious diseases likely to spread owing to climate change. We combine a variety of direct effects of temperature on vector ecology, vector biology and vector-parasite interactions via a disease transmission model and extrapolate the potential compounding effects of projected warming on the epidemiology of African trypanosomiasis. The model predicts that epidemics can occur when mean temperatures are between 20.7degreeC and 26.1degreeC. Our model does not predict a large-range expansion, but rather a large shift of up to 60 per cent in the geographical extent of the range. The model also predicts that 46-77 million additional people may be at risk of exposure by 2090. Future research could expand our analysis to include other environmental factors that influence tsetse populations and disease transmission such as humidity, as well as changes to human, livestock and wildlife distributions. The modelling approach presented here provides a framework for using the climate-sensitive aspects of vector and pathogen biology to predict changes in disease prevalence and risk owing to climate change. © 2011 The Royal Society.

N2  - Australia is free of many diseases, pests and weeds found elsewhere in the world due to its geographical isolation and relatively good health security practices. However, its health security is under increasing pressure due to a number of ecological, climatic, demographic and behavioural changes occurring globally. North Queensland is a high risk area (a health security hot spot) for Australia, due in part to its connection to neighbouring countries via the Torres Strait and the Indo-Papuan conduit, its high diversity of wildlife reservoirs and its environmental characteristics. Major outbreaks of exotic diseases, pests and weeds in Australia can cost in excess of $1. billion; however, most expenditure on health security is reactive apart from preventive measures undertaken for a few high profile diseases, pests and weeds. Large gains in health security could therefore be made by spending more on pre-emptive approaches to reduce the risk of outbreaks, invasion/spread and establishment, despite these gains being difficult to quantify. Although biosecurity threats may initially have regional impacts (e.g. Hendra virus), a break down in security in health security hot spots can have national and international consequences, as has been seen recently in other regions with the emergence of SARS and pandemic avian influenza. Novel approaches should be driven by building research and management capacity, particularly in the regions where threats arise, a model that is applicable both in Australia and in other regions of the world that value and therefore aim to improve their strategies for maintaining health security. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Optimizing surveillance for livestock disease spreading through animal movements

N2  - The spatial propagation of many livestock infectious diseases critically depends on the animal movements among premises; so the knowledge of movement data may help us to detect, manage and control an outbreak. The identification of robust spreading features of the system is however hampered by the temporal dimension characterizing population interactions through movements. Traditional centrality measures do not provide relevant information as results strongly fluctuate in time and outbreak properties heavily depend on geotemporal initial conditions. By focusing on the case study of cattle displacements in Italy, we aim at characterizing livestock epidemics in terms of robust features useful for planning and control, to deal with temporal fluctuations, sensitivity to initial conditions and missing information during an outbreak. Through spatial disease simulations, we detect spreading paths that are stable across different initial conditions, allowing the clustering of the seeds and reducing the epidemic variability. Paths also allow us to identify premises, called sentinels, having a large probability of being infected and providing critical information on the outbreak origin, as encoded in the clusters. This novel procedure provides a general framework that can be applied to specific diseases, for aiding risk assessment analysis and informing the design of optimal surveillance systems. © 2012 The Royal Society.

T1  - Outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry in Thailand: The relative role of poultry production types in sustaining transmission and the impact of active surveillance in control

N2  - H5N1, highly pathogenic avian influenza, continues to pose a public health risk in the countries of southeast Asia where it has become endemic. However, in Thailand, which experienced two of the largest recorded epidemics in 2004-2005, the disease has been successfully reduced to very low levels. We fitted a spatio-temporal model of the spread of infection to outbreak data collected during the second wave of outbreaks to assess the extent to which different poultry types were responsible for propagating infection. Our estimates suggest that the wave of outbreaks would not have been possible without the contribution of backyard flocks to the susceptibility of a sub-district. However, we also estimated that outbreaks involving commercial poultry, a much larger sector in Thailand than in neighbouring countries, were disproportionately infectious, a factor which was also crucial in sustaining the wave. As a result, implemented measures that aim to reduce the role of commercial farms in the spread of infection, such as the drive to bring aspects of the supply chain 'in house', may help to explain the subsequent success in controlling H5N1 in Thailand. We also found that periods of active surveillance substantially improved the rate of outbreak detection. © 2012 The Royal Society.

T1  - Methods to infer transmission risk factors in complex outbreak data
A1  - Cauchemez S.
A1  - Ferguson N.M. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Data collected during outbreaks are essential to better understand infectious disease transmission and design effective control strategies. But analysis of such data is challenging owing to the dependency between observations that is typically observed in an outbreak and to missing data. In this paper, we discuss strategies to tackle some of the ongoing challenges in the analysis of outbreak data. We present a relatively generic statistical model for the estimation of transmission risk factors, and discuss algorithms to estimate its parameters for different levels of missing data. We look at the problem of computational times for relatively large datasets and show how they can be reduced by appropriate use of discretization, sufficient statistics and some simple assumptions on the natural history of the disease. We also discuss approaches to integrate parametric model fitting and tree reconstruction methods in coherent statistical analyses. The methods are tested on both real and simulated datasets of large outbreaks in structured populations. © 2011 The Royal Society.

T1  - Impact of regulatory perturbations to disease spread through cattle movements in Great Britain
A1  - Vernon M.C.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - During the past decade the British livestock industry has suffered from several major pathogen outbreaks, and a variety of regulatory and disease control measures have been applied to the movement of livestock with the express aim of mitigating the spread of infection. The Rapid Analysis and Detection of Animal-related Risks (RADAR) project, which has been collecting data on the movement of cattle since 1998, provides a relatively comprehensive record of how these policies have influenced the movement of cattle between animal holdings, markets, and slaughterhouses in Britain. Many previous studies have focused on the properties of the network that can be derived from these movements - treating farms as nodes and movements as directed (and potentially weighted) edges in the network. However, of far greater importance is how these policy changes have influenced the potential spread of infectious diseases. Here we use a stochastic fully individual-based model of cattle in Britain to assess how the epidemic potential has varied from 2000 to 2009 as the pattern of movements has changed in response to legislation and market forces. Our simulations show that the majority of policy changes lead to significant decreases in the epidemic potential (measured in multiple ways), but that this potential then increases through time as cattle farmers modify their behaviour in response. Our results suggest that the cattle industry is likely to experience boom-bust dynamics, with the actions that farmers take during epidemic-free periods to maximise their profitability likely to increase the potential for large-scale epidemics to occur. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: During the 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 (2009) virus (pH1N1) outbreak, school students were at an increased risk of infection by the pH1N1 virus. However, the estimation of the attack rate showed significant variability. Method(s): Two school outbreaks were investigated in this study. A questionnaire was designed to collect information by interview. Throat samples were collected from all the subjects in this study 6 times and sero samples 3 times to confirm the infection and to determine viral shedding. Data analysis was performed using the software STATA 9.0. Finding(s): The attack rate of the pH1N1 outbreak was 58.3% for the primary school, and 52.9% for the middle school. The asymptomatic infection rates of the two schools were 35.8% and 37.6% respectively. Peak virus shedding occurred on the day of ARI symptoms onset, followed by a steady decrease over subsequent days (p = 0.026). No difference was found either in viral shedding or HI titer between the symptomatic and the asymptomatic infectious groups. Conclusion(s): School children were found to be at a high risk of infection by the novel virus. This may be because of a heightened risk of transmission owing to increased mixing at boarding school, or a lack of immunity owing to socio-economic status. We conclude that asymptomatically infectious cases may play an important role in transmission of the pH1N1 virus. © 2012 Yan et al.

N2  - From February to May 2012, Mayotte experienced an outbreak of acute conjunctivitis with over 12,000 estimated cases, causing a significant burden on the primary healthcare system. It was most certainly caused by a coxsackievirus, as documented by isolation from a symptomatic traveller from the Comoros Islands in France. Tropical climate and poor hygiene conditions facilitate the spread of infectious diseases on Mayotte and in the region with risk of further exportation to mainland France and Europe.

N2  - BACKGROUND:: Despite >50 years of universal vaccination, pertussis remains the most prevalent vaccine-preventable infectious disease in developed countries. Pertussis is often mild in adults, but can run a severe course in young infants. METHOD(S):: Data on transmission of pertussis within households were captured in a population-based, nationwide, prospective study performed in the Netherlands between February 2006 and December 2009. We estimated the transmission rates of pertussis with a clinically confirmed infection in 140 households, using stochastic epidemic models. Parameter estimates were used to gauge the effect of vaccinating household members (cocooning) to prevent the infection in young infants. RESULT(S):: Overall transmission rates in the household were high. Fathers were less susceptible than other household members (estimated relative susceptibility of fathers = 0.44 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.27-0.72]), whereas mothers may be more infectious to their infants than are other household members (estimated relative infectiousness of mothers = 3.9 [95% CI = 0.59-14]). Targeted vaccination of mothers would approximately halve the probability of infants' infection. Vaccination of siblings is less effective in preventing transmission within the household, but may be as effective overall because siblings more often introduce an infection in the household. Vaccination of fathers is expected to be least effective. CONCLUSION(S):: Selective vaccination of persons in households with a young infant may substantially reduce the disease burden of pertussis in infants by reducing transmission within the household.

N2  - Influenza infection natural history is often described as a progression through four successive stages: Susceptible-Exposed/Latent-Infectious-Removed (SEIR). The duration of each stage determines the average generation time, the time between infection of a case and infection of his/her infector.Recently, several authors have justified somewhat arbitrary choices in stage durations by how close the resulting generation time distribution was to viral excretion over time after infection. Taking this reasoning one step further, we propose that the viral excretion profile over time can be used directly to estimate the required parameters in an SEIR model. In our approach, the latency and infectious period distributions are estimated by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model-based generation time probability density function and the normalized average viral excretion profile.Following this approach, we estimated that the latency and infectious period last respectively 1.6 and 1.0 days on average using excretion profiles from experimental infections. Interestingly, we find that only 5% of cases are infectious for more than 2.9 days. We also discuss the consequences of these estimates for the evaluation of the efficacy of control measures such as isolation or treatment. We estimate that, under a best-case scenario where symptoms appear at the end of the latency period, index cases must be isolated or treated at most within 16. h after symptoms onset to avoid 50% of secondary cases.This study provides the first estimates of latency and infectious period for influenza based directly on viral excretion data. It provides additional evidence that isolation or treatment of cases would be effective only if adopted shortly after symptoms onset, and shows that four days of isolation may be enough to avoid most transmissions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Human migration caused by political unrest, wars and poverty is a major topic in international health. Infectious diseases like tuberculosis follow their host, with potential impact on both the migrants and the population in the recipient countries. In this study, we evaluate Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission between the national population and migrants in Denmark. Method(s): Register study based on IS6110-RFLP results from nationwide genotyping of tuberculosis cases during 1992 through 2004. Cases with 100% identical genotypes were defined as clustered and part of a transmission chain. Origin of clusters involving both Danes and migrants was defined as Danish/migrant/uncertain. Subsequently, the proportion of cases likely infected by the "opposite" ethnic group was estimated. Result(s): 4,631 cases were included, representing 99% of culture confirmed cases during 1992 through 2004. Migrants contributed 61.6% of cases. Up to 7.9% (95% CI 7.0-8.9) of migrants were infected by Danes. The corresponding figure was 5.8% (95% CI 4.8-7.0) for Danes. Thus, transmission from Danes to migrants occurred up to 2.5 (95% CI 1.8-3.5) times more frequent than vice versa (OR = 1). A dominant strain, Cluster-2, was almost exclusively found in Danes, particular younger-middle-aged males. Conclusion(s): Transmission between Danes and migrants is limited, and risk of being infected by the "opposite" ethnic group is highest for migrants. TB-control efforts should focus on continues micro-epidemics, e.g. with Cluster-2 in Danes, prevention of reactivation TB in high-risk migrants, and outbreaks in socially marginalized migrants, such as Somalis and Greenlanders. Fears that TB in migrants poses a threat for resident Danes seem exaggerated and unjustified. We believe this to be true for other low incidence countries as well. © 2012 Kamper-Jorgensen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - In the demand for a decision support tool to guide farmers wanting to control Salmonella Dublin (S. Dublin) in Danish dairy herds, we developed an age-structured stochastic, mechanistic and dynamic simulation model of S. Dublin in dairy herds, which incorporated six age groups (neonatal, preweaned calves, weaned calves, growing heifers, breeding heifers and cows) and five infection states (susceptible, acutely infected, carrier, super shedder and resistant). The model simulated population and infection dynamics over a period of 10 years in weekly time steps as: 1) population sizes of each of the six age-groups; 2) S. Dublin incidence and number of animals in each infection state; and 3) S. Dublin related morbidity and mortality in the acutely infected animals. The effects of introducing one infectious heifer on the risk of spread of S. Dublin within the herd and on the duration of infection were estimated through 1000 simulation iterations for 48 scenarios. The scenarios covered all combinations of three herd sizes (70, 200 and 400 cows), four hygiene levels indicating infectious contact parameters, and four herd susceptibility levels indicating different susceptibility parameters for the individual animals in each of the six age groups in the herd.The hygiene level was highly influential on the probability that the infection spread within the herd, duration of infection and epidemic size. The herd susceptibility level was also influential, but not likely to provide sufficient prevention and control of infection on its own. Herd size did not affect the probability of infection spread upon exposure, but the larger the herd the more important were management and housing practices that improve hygiene and reduce susceptibility to shorten durations of infection in the herd and to increase the probability of extinction. In general, disease and mortality patterns followed epidemic waves in the herds. However, an interesting pattern was seen for acute infections and abortions in adult cattle after the first 2 years of infection in herds with poor hygiene and high susceptibility. Repeated infections in young stock lead to a high proportion of resistant adult cattle, which lead to a dampening effect on acute infections in adults and associated abortions. Sensitivity analyses of 24 alternative scenarios showed that a super shedder state was not essential to mimic the infection dynamics and persistence patterns known from field studies, but a persistent carrier state was required in the model to mimic real life S. Dublin infections. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Epidemics of novel or re-emerging infectious diseases have quickly spread globally via air travel, as highlighted by pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009 (pH1N1). Federal, state, and local public health responders must be able to plan for and respond to these events at aviation points of entry. The emergence of a novel influenza virus and its spread to the United States were simulated for February 2009 from 55 international metropolitan areas using three basic reproduction numbers (R0): 1.53, 1.70, and 1.90. Empirical data from the pH1N1 virus were used to validate our SEIR model. Time to entry to the U.S. during the early stages of a prototypical novel communicable disease was predicted based on the aviation network patterns and the epidemiology of the disease. For example, approximately 96% of origins (R0 of 1.53) propagated a disease into the U.S. in under 75 days, 90% of these origins propagated a disease in under 50 days. An R0 of 1.53 reproduced the pH1NI observations. The ability to anticipate the rate and location of disease introduction into the U.S. provides greater opportunity to plan responses based on the scenario as it is unfolding. This simulation tool can aid public health officials to assess risk and leverage resources efficiently. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - The monthly and annual incidence of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in China for 2004-2009 was analysed in conjunction with associated geographical and demographic data. We applied the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model to fit and forecast monthly HFRS incidence in China. HFRS was endemic in most regions of China except Hainan Province. There was a high risk of infection for male farmers aged 30-50 years. The fitted SARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)12 model had a root-mean-square-error criterion of 00133 that indicated accurate forecasts were possible. These findings have practical applications for more effective HFRS control and prevention. The conducted SARIMA model may have applications as a decision support tool in HFRS control and risk-management planning programmes. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2011.

N2  - The incidence of extreme precipitation has increased with the exacerbation of worldwide climate disruption. We hypothesize an association between precipitation and the distribution patterns that would affect the endemic burden of 8 infectious diseases in Taiwan, including water- and vector-borne infectious diseases. A database integrating daily precipitation and temperature, along with the infectious disease case registry for all 352 townships in the main island of Taiwan was analysed for the period from 1994 to 2008. Four precipitation levels, <130 mm, 130-200 mm, 200-350 mm and >350 mm, were categorized to represent quantitative differences, and their associations with each specific disease was investigated using the Generalized Additive Mixed Model and afterwards mapped on to the Geographical Information System. Daily precipitation levels were significantly correlated with all 8 mandatory-notified infectious diseases in Taiwan. For water-borne infections, extreme torrential precipitation (>350 mm/day) was found to result in the highest relative risk for bacillary dysentery and enterovirus infections when compared to ordinary rain (<130 mm/day). Yet, for vector-borne diseases, the relative risk of dengue fever and Japanese encephalitis increased with greater precipitation only up to 350 mm. Differential lag effects following precipitation were statistically associated with increased risk for contracting individual infectious diseases. This study's findings can help health resource sector management better allocate medical resources and be better prepared to deal with infectious disease outbreaks following future extreme precipitation events. © 2012 Chen et al.

N2  - Background: Water plays an important role in the transmission of many infectious diseases, which pose a great burden on global public health. However, the global distribution of these water-associated infectious diseases and underlying factors remain largely unexplored. Methods and Findings: Based on the Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON), a global database including water-associated pathogens and diseases was developed. In this study, reported outbreak events associated with corresponding water-associated infectious diseases from 1991 to 2008 were extracted from the database. The location of each reported outbreak event was identified and geocoded into a GIS database. Also collected in the GIS database included geo-referenced socio-environmental information including population density (2000), annual accumulated temperature, surface water area, and average annual precipitation. Poisson models with Bayesian inference were developed to explore the association between these socio-environmental factors and distribution of the reported outbreak events. Based on model predictions a global relative risk map was generated. A total of 1,428 reported outbreak events were retrieved from the database. The analysis suggested that outbreaks of water-associated diseases are significantly correlated with socio-environmental factors. Population density is a significant risk factor for all categories of reported outbreaks of water-associated diseases; water-related diseases (e.g., vector-borne diseases) are associated with accumulated temperature; water-washed diseases (e.g., conjunctivitis) are inversely related to surface water area; both water-borne and water-related diseases are inversely related to average annual rainfall. Based on the model predictions, "hotspots" of risks for all categories of water-associated diseases were explored. Conclusion(s): At the global scale, water-associated infectious diseases are significantly correlated with socio-environmental factors, impacting all regions which are affected disproportionately by different categories of water-associated infectious diseases. © 2012 Yang et al.

N2  - Two prospective longitudinal studies in 13 postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS)-affected farms from Spain (n= 3) and Denmark (n= 10) were performed. Blood samples from pigs were longitudinally collected from 1st week until the occurrence of the PMWS outbreak. Wasted and healthy age-matched pigs were euthanized, necropsied and histopathologically characterised. PMWS diagnosis was confirmed by means of lymphoid lesions and detection of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in these tissues by in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry. Serological analyses were performed in longitudinally collected serum samples to detect antibodies against, PCV2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine parvovirus (PPV), swine influenza virus (SIV) and Lawsonia intracellularis (law), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) and Salmonella spp. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to investigate the simultaneous effects of seroconversion and maternal immunity against the studied pathogens. Results showed that high levels of maternal immunity against PCV2 had a protecting effect in farms from both countries. Moreover, for the Danish dataset, seroconversion against law had an overall protecting effect, but for animals with very low levels of maternal antibody levels against this pathogen, the effect appeared neutral or aggravating. Otherwise, for the Spanish dataset, maternal immunity against PPV and PRRSV gave protective and aggravating effects, respectively. In conclusion, the present study reflects the complex interaction among different pathogens and their effects in order to trigger PMWS in PCV2 infected pigs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - The basic reproduction number and the probability of extinction for a dynamic epidemic model
A1  - Neal P. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - We consider the spread of an epidemic through a population divided into n sub-populations, in which individuals move between populations according to a Markov transition matrix SIGMA and infectives can only make infectious contacts with members of their current population. Expressions for the basic reproduction number, R0, and the probability of extinction of the epidemic are derived. It is shown that in contrast to contact distribution models, the distribution of the infectious period effects both the basic reproduction number and the probability of extinction of the epidemic in the limit as the total population size N->. The interactions between the infectious period distribution and the transition matrix SIGMA mean that it is not possible to draw general conclusions about the effects on R0 and the probability of extinction. However, it is shown that for n=2, the basic reproduction number, R0, is maximised by a constant length infectious period and is decreasing in sigma, the speed of movement between the two populations. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Since the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak of 2001 in the United Kingdom, there has been debate about the sharing, between government and industry, both the costs of livestock disease outbreaks and responsibility for the decisions that give rise to them. As part of a consultation into the formation of a new body to manage livestock diseases, government veterinarians and economists produced estimates of the average annual costs for a number of exotic infectious diseases. In this article, we demonstrate how the government experts were helped to quantify their uncertainties about the cost estimates using formal expert elicitation techniques. This has enabled the decisionmakers to have a greater appreciation of government experts' uncertainty in this policy area. © 2011 Society for Risk Analysis.

N2  - Background. In early 2009, a dairy-goat annex care farm in South Limburg, the Netherlands, reported 220 Coxiella burnetii-related abortions in 450 pregnant goats. These preceded human cases and occurred in a region that was Q-fever free before 2009, providing a unique quasi-experimental setting for investigating regional transmission patterns associated with a Q-fever point source.Methods. Index-farm residents/employees, visitors, and their household contacts were traced and screened for C. burnetii. Distribution of community cases was analysed using a geographic information system. True incidence, including undetected infections, was estimated regionwide by seroprevalence in a pre- versus postoutbreak sample, and near-farm by immunoglobulin M seroprevalence in a municipal population sample. Environmental bacterial load was repeatedly measured in surface and aerosol samples.Results. Serological attack rate was 92% (24/26) in index-farm residents/employees, 56% (28/50) in visitors, and 50% (7/14) in household contacts, and the clinical attack rate (ie, the proportion of persons seropositive for acute infection who also had clinical illness) was >=80%. Notified symptomatic community cases (n = 253) were scattered downwind from the index farm, following a significant exposure-response gradient. Observed incidence ranged from 6.3% (0-1 km) to 0.1% (4-5 km), and remained high beyond. True incidence of infections was estimated at 2.9% regionwide, extrapolating to 8941 infections; estimated near-farm incidence was 12%. Coxiella burnetii load was high on-farm (2009), and lower off-farm (2009-2010).Conclusions. Linking a single dairy-goat farm to a human Q-fever cluster, we show widespread transmission, massive numbers of undetected infections, and high attack rates on- and off-farm, even beyond a 5-km high-risk zone. Our investigation may serve as an essential case study for risk assessment in public health and related fields such as bioterrorism response and preparedness. © The Author 2012.

N2  - Background: The majority of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic (transmissible between animals and humans) in origin, and therefore integrated surveillance of disease events in humans and animals has been recommended to support effective global response to disease emergence. While in the past decade there has been extensive global surveillance for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infection in both animals and humans, there have been few attempts to compare these data streams and evaluate the utility of such integration. Methodology: We compared reports of bird outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in Egypt for 2006-2011 compiled by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) EMPRESi reporting system with confirmed human H5N1 cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) for Egypt during the same time period. Principal Findings: Both human cases and bird outbreaks showed a cyclic pattern for the country as a whole, and there was a statistically significant temporal correlation between the data streams. At the governorate level, the first outbreak in birds in a season usually but not always preceded the first human case, and the time lag between events varied widely, suggesting regional differences in zoonotic risk and/or surveillance effectiveness. In a multivariate risk model, lower temperature, lower urbanization, higher poultry density, and the recent occurrence of a bird outbreak were associated with increased risk of a human case of HPAI in the same governorate, although the positive predictive value of a bird outbreak was low. Conclusion(s): Integrating data streams of surveillance for human and animal cases of zoonotic disease holds promise for better prediction of disease risk and identification of environmental and regional factors that can affect risk. Such efforts can also point out gaps in human and animal surveillance systems and generate hypotheses regarding disease transmission. © 2012 Rabinowitz et al.

T1  - Estimating Coextinction Risks from Epidemic Tree Death: Affiliate Lichen Communities among Diseased Host Tree Populations of Fraxinus excelsior
A1  - Jonsson M.T.
A1  - Thor G. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - At least 10% of the world's tree species are threatened with extinction and pathogens are increasingly implicated in tree threats. Coextinction and threats to affiliates as a consequence of the loss or decline of their host trees is a poorly understood phenomenon. Ash dieback is an emerging infectious disease causing severe dieback of common ash Fraxinus excelsior throughout Europe. We utilized available empirical data on affiliate epiphytic lichen diversity (174 species and 17,800 observations) among 20 ash dieback infected host tree populations of F. excelsior on the island Gotland in the Baltic Sea, Sweden. From this, we used structured scenario projections scaled with empirical data of ash dieback disease to generate probabilistic models for estimating local and regional lichen coextinction risks. Average coextinction probabilities (A) were 0.38 (95% CI +/-0.09) for lichens occurring on F. excelsior and 0.14 (95% CI +/-0.03) when considering lichen persistence on all tree species. A was strongly linked to local disease incidence levels and generally increasing with lichen host specificity to F. excelsior and decreasing population size. Coextinctions reduced affiliate community viability, with significant local reductions in species richness and shifts in lichen species composition. Affiliates were projected to become locally extirpated before their hosts, illuminating the need to also consider host tree declines. Traditionally managed open wooded meadows had the highest incidence of ash dieback disease and significantly higher proportions of affiliate species projected to go extinct, compared with unmanaged closed forests and semi-open grazed sites. Most cothreatened species were not previously red-listed, which suggest that tree epidemics cause many unforeseen threats to species. Our analysis shows that epidemic tree deaths represent an insidious, mostly overlooked, threat to sessile affiliate communities in forested environments. Current conservation and management strategies must account for secondary extinctions associated with epidemic tree death. © 2012 Jonsson, Thor.

N2  - Estimates of the per-contact probability of transmission between farms of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza virus of H7N7 subtype during the 2003 epidemic in the Netherlands are important for the design of better control and biosecurity strategies. We used standardized data collected during the epidemic and a model to extract data for untraced contacts based on the daily number of infectious farms within a given distance of a susceptible farm. With these data, we used a maximum likelihood estimation approach to estimate the transmission probabilities by the individual contact types, both traced and untraced. The estimated conditional probabilities, conditional on the contact originating from an infectious farm, of virus transmission were: 0.000057 per infectious farm within 1 km per day, 0.000413 per infectious farm between 1 and 3 km per day, 0.0000895 per infectious farm between 3 and 10 km per day, 0.0011 per crisis organisation contact, 0.0414 per feed delivery contact, 0.308 per egg transport contact, 0.133 per other-professional contact and, 0.246 per rendering contact. We validate these outcomes against literature data on virus genetic sequences for outbreak farms. These estimates can be used to inform further studies on the role that improved biosecurity between contacts and/or contact frequency reduction can play in eliminating between-farm spread of the virus during future epidemics. The findings also highlight the need to; 1) understand the routes underlying the infections without traced contacts and, 2) to review whether the contact-tracing protocol is exhaustive in relation to all the farm's day-to-day activities and practices. © 2012 Ssematimba et al.

N2  - Large-scale immunization has profoundly impacted control of many infectious diseases such as measles and smallpox because of the ability of vaccination campaigns to maintain long-term herd immunity and, hence, indirect protection of the unvaccinated. In the case of human influenza, such potential benefits of mass vaccination have so far proved elusive. The central difficulty is a considerable viral capacity for immune escape; new pandemic variants, as well as viral escape mutants in seasonal influenza, compromise the buildup of herd immunity from natural infection or deployment of current vaccines. Consequently, most current influenza vaccination programs focus mainly on protection of specific risk groups, rather than mass prophylactic protection. Here, we use epidemiological models to show that emerging vaccine technologies, aimed at broad-spectrum protection, could qualitatively alter this picture. We demonstrate that sustained immunization with such vaccines could - through potentially lowering transmission rates and improving herd immunity - significantly moderate both influenza pandemic and seasonal epidemics. More subtly, phylodynamic models indicate that widespread cross-protective immunization could slow the antigenic evolution of seasonal influenza; these effects have profound implications for a transition to mass vaccination strategies against human influenza, and for the management of antigenically variable viruses in general.

T1  - Trends in notifiable infectious diseases in Vhina: Implications for surveillance and population health policy
A1  - Zhang L.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - This study aimed to analyse trends in notifiable infectious diseases in China, in their historical context. Both English and Chinese literature was searched and diseases were categorised according to the type of disease or transmission route. Temporal trends of morbidity and mortality rates were calculated for eight major infectious diseases types. Strong government commitment to public health responses and improvements in quality of life has led to the eradication or containment of a wide range of infectious diseases in China. The overall infectious diseases burden experienced a dramatic drop during 1975-1995, but since then, it reverted and maintained a gradual upward trend to date. Most notifiable diseases are contained at a low endemic level; however, local small-scale outbreaks remain common. Tuberculosis, as a bacterial infection, has re-emerged since the 1990s and has become prevalent in the country. Sexually transmitted infections are in a rapid, exponential growth phase, spreading from core groups to the general population. Together human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), they account for 39% of all death cases due to infectious diseases in China in 2008. Zoonotic infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), rabies and influenza, pose constant threats to Chinese residents and remain the most deadly disease type among the infected individuals. Therefore, second-generation surveillance of behavioural risks or vectors associated with pathogen transmission should be scaled up. It is necessary to implement public health interventions that target HIV and relevant coinfections, address transmission associated with highly mobile populations, and reduce the risk of cross-species transmission of zoonotic pathogens. © 2012 Zhang, Wilson.

N2  - The population dynamics of endemic cholera in urban environments - in particular interannual variation in the size and distribution of seasonal outbreaks - remain poorly understood and highly unpredictable. In part, this situation is due to the considerable demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental heterogeneity of large and growing urban centers. Despite this heterogeneity, the influence of climate variability on the population dynamics of infectious diseases is considered a large-scale, regional, phenomenon, and as such has been previously addressed for cholera only with temporal models that do not incorporate spatial structure. Here we show that a probabilistic spatial model can explain cholera dynamics in the megacity of Dhaka, Bangladesh, and afford a basis for cholera forecasts at lead times of 11 mo. Critically, we find that the action of climate variability (El Nino southern oscillation and flooding) is quite localized: There is a climate-sensitive urban core that acts to propagate risk to the rest of the city. The modeling framework presented here should be applicable to cholera in other cities, as well as to other infectious diseases in urban settings and other biological systems with spatiotemporal interactions.

N2  - A social (sexual) network is modeled by an extension of the configuration model to the situation where edges have weights, e.g., reflecting the number of sex-contacts between the individuals. An epidemic model is defined on the network such that individuals are heterogeneous in terms of how susceptible and infectious they are. The basic reproduction number R0 is derived and studied for various examples, but also the size and probability of a major outbreak. The qualitative conclusion is that R0 gets larger as the community becomes more heterogeneous but that different heterogeneities (degree distribution, weight, susceptibility and infectivity) can sometimes have the cumulative effect of homogenizing the community, thus making R0 smaller. The effect on the probability and final size of an outbreak is more complicated. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been associated with several exanthematic outbreaks in bovine, human, and equine species in Brazilian rural areas. Little is known about VACV reservoirs, although it is believed that rodents could be associated with VACV outbreaks. With the goal of filling one more gap in the VACV ecological puzzle, the present work aimed at mimicking a potential transmission route of VACV between cows and rodents, both known as natural VACV hosts. Balb/c mice were exposed to feces of experimentally VACV infected cows for 20 days, and samples from these mice were examined by using molecular and serological tests. VACV DNA was detected in feces and blood samples after several days of exposure; infectious VACV particles were also detected in the feces. The presence of anti-VACV neutralizing antibodies in murine sera further suggested horizontal transmission. If the transmission model described here can be applied to natural environments, exposure to bovine feces could be considered a risk factor for the spread of VACV; consequently, the traditional use of bovine manure as a fertilizer in agricultural activities may be promoting the infection of rodents. © 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a prion disease spread by the inclusion in cattle feed of meat and bone meal made from cattle infected with the BSE agent. In the Republic of Ireland, a reinforced feed ban on mammalian meat and bone meal (MMBM) was introduced on 17th October 1996 to stop further infection of cattle. Between then and July 2010, 44 cases of BSE from 40 herds have been born, termed " born after the reinforced ban" or " BARB" cases. The objectives of this project were: (a) to describe the epidemiology of these BARB cases, (b) to determine area-level risk factors for BSE herds and how they related to the stage of the BSE epidemic, and (c) to evaluate whether the spatial pattern of BSE cases was non-random and had changed over time. The BSE epidemic was divided into three phases: cases born prior to 1991, born 1991-October 1996 and BARB cases. To determine the area level risk factors for BSE herds, a case-control study was conducted for each phase of the epidemic. We selected four control herds for each herd with one or more BSE cases. A grid of hexagons of 10. km diameter was created covering the territory of the Republic of Ireland and BSE herds and control herds were assigned to a hexagon. The numbers of cattle herds, dairy herds, piggeries and poultry holdings within the hexagons containing these case and control herds were enumerated. To evaluate the spatial pattern of BSE cases, standardised mortality ratios were calculated for each hexagon, and Oden's Ipop was used to investigate clustering. The descriptive analysis showed " feeding of concentrates" as the only common factor to all BARB cases for which information existed. The case-control study identified being a dairy herd as a risk factor during the pre-1991 phase of the BSE epidemic. Dairy herd type, a large proportion of local herds which were dairy and large numbers of piggeries and poultry holdings locally were also risk factors during the 1991-1996 phase. For the post-October 1996 phase (BARBs), dairy herd type and large numbers of other herds locally were risk factors. The spatial pattern of BSE cases changed over the three phases of the epidemic and was non-random, with evidence of clustering. The evidence supports the hypothesis that BARB cases do not arise spontaneously but rather are caused by the same food-borne infectious route as other BSE cases. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background.Data are limited on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated influenza burden in sub-Saharan Africa and the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We compared influenza-related mortality in adults with AIDS in South Africa and the United States in the pre-HAART era and evaluated mortality trends after HAART introduction in the United States.Methods.Monthly all-cause and pneumonia and influenza (P&I) mortality rates were compiled for adults with AIDS aged 25-54 years in South Africa (1998-2005) and the United States (pre-HAART era, 1987-1994; HAART era, 1997-2005). We estimated influenza-related deaths as excess mortality above a model baseline during influenza epidemic periods. Influenza-related mortality rates in adults with AIDS were compared with rates for age peers in the general population and adults >=65 years old.Results.In the United States before HAART, influenza-related mortality rates in adults with AIDS were 150 (95 confidence interval [CI], 49-460) and 208 (95 CI, 74-583) times greater than in the general population for all-cause and P&I deaths, respectively, and 2.5 (95 CI, 0.9-7.2) and 4.1 (95 CI, 1.4-13) times higher than in elderly adults. After HAART introduction, influenza-related mortality in adults with AIDS dropped 3-6-fold but remained elevated compared with the general population (all-cause relative risk [RR], 44 [95 CI, 16-121]); P&I RR, 73 [95 CI, 47-113]). Influenza-related mortality in South African adults with AIDS in recent years was similar to that in the United States in the pre-HAART era.Conclusions.Adults with AIDS experience substantially elevated influenza-associated mortality, which declines with widespread HAART introduction but does not disappear. These data support increased access to HAART and influenza vaccination for HIV-infected adults. © The Author 2012.

T1  - The use of expert opinion to assess the risk of emergence or re-emergence of infectious diseases in Canada associated with climate change

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Global climate change is predicted to lead to an increase in infectious disease outbreaks. Reliable surveillance for diseases that are most likely to emerge is required, and given limited resources, policy decision makers need rational methods with which to prioritise pathogen threats. Here expert opinion was collected to determine what criteria could be used to prioritise diseases according to the likelihood of emergence in response to climate change and according to their impact. We identified a total of 40 criteria that might be used for this purpose in the Canadian context. The opinion of 64 experts from academic, government and independent backgrounds was collected to determine the importance of the criteria. A weight was calculated for each criterion based on the expert opinion. The five that were considered most influential on disease emergence or impact were: potential economic impact, severity of disease in the general human population, human case fatality rate, the type of climate that the pathogen can tolerate and the current climatic conditions in Canada. There was effective consensus about the influence of some criteria among participants, while for others there was considerable variation. The specific climate criteria that were most likely to influence disease emergence were: an annual increase in temperature, an increase in summer temperature, an increase in summer precipitation and to a lesser extent an increase in winter temperature. These climate variables were considered to be most influential on vector-borne diseases and on food and water-borne diseases. Opinion about the influence of climate on air-borne diseases and diseases spread by direct/indirect contact were more variable. The impact of emerging diseases on the human population was deemed more important than the impact on animal populations. © 2012 Cox et al.

N2  - Knowledge on the transmission tree of an epidemic can provide valuable insights into disease dynamics. The transmission tree can be reconstructed by analysing either detailed epidemiological data (e.g. contact tracing) or, if sufficient genetic diversity accumulates over the course of the epidemic, genetic data of the pathogen.We present a likelihood-based framework to integrate these two data types, estimating probabilities of infection by taking weighted averages over the set of possible transmission trees. We test the approach by applying it to temporal, geographical and genetic data on the 241 poultry farms infected in an epidemic of avian influenza A (H7N7) in The Netherlands in 2003. We show that the combined approach estimates the transmission tree with higher correctness and resolution than analyses based on genetic or epidemiological data alone. Furthermore, the estimated tree reveals the relative infectiousness of farms of different types and sizes. © 2011 The Royal Society.

N2  - Human noroviruses (hNoV) have been detected on soft fruits. Especially raspberries have been found to be associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis suggesting persistence of hNoV on these fruits. Therefore, the persistence of hNoV GII.4 and GI.4, murine norovirus (MNV-1, a culturable surrogate for hNoV), and human adenovirus (hAdV, an indicator for human fecal contamination), on raspberries, strawberries and in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 4degreeC, 10degreeC and 21degreeC, mimicking commonly applied storage conditions was studied by molecular and cell culture techniques. Monophasic, biphasic and Weibull models were fitted to virus counts with maximum likelihood estimation. The tested viruses were persistent (<=0.5 log10-unit reduction in viral titer) under all studied conditions in PBS, at 4degreeC and 10degreeC on raspberries, and at 4degreeC on strawberries. The difference in viral persistence on raspberries and strawberries was most pronounced at 21degreeC. Here, infectious MNV-1 and hAdV particles decayed rapidly on strawberries with TFL-values (time for the first log10-unit reduction) of only 1day (95% CI of 0.6-1 and 0.8-1days, respectively). On raspberries, however, the TFL-value of infectious MNV-1 was found to likely exceed the shelf life of the berries with 3days (95% CI of 2.8-3.1days); hAdV remained infectious with only 0.3 log10-unit reduction (95% CI of 0.2-0.4) in viral titer. For hNoV GI, a TFL-value of 2days (95% CI 1-4days) was determined based on the targeted genome fragment, whereas the TFL-value of hNoV GII exceeded the shelf life of strawberries at 21degreeC. The greater viral persistence on raspberries as compared to strawberries, especially at 21degreeC, may at least in part explain why raspberries are more frequently associated with hNoV outbreaks than strawberries. Moreover, our results show that due to the high persistence of the virus already low contamination levels of the highly infectious hNoV may be associated with an infection risk of humans after consumption of raspberries. The estimated decay parameters and uncertainties of this study serve as important input requirements in the quantitative assessment of public health risks from the consumption of soft fruits. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Risk perception and effectiveness of uncoordinated behavioral responses in an emerging epidemic
A1  - Poletti P.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Beyond control measures imposed by public authorities, human behavioral changes can be triggered by uncoordinated responses driven by the risk perception of an emerging epidemic. In order to account for spontaneous social distancing, a model based on an evolutionary game theory framework is here proposed. Behavioral changes are modeled through an imitation process in which the convenience of different behaviors depends on the perceived prevalence of infections. Effects of misperception of risk induced by partial or incorrect information concerning the state of the epidemic are considered as well. Our findings highlight that, if the perceived risk associated to an epidemic is sufficiently large, then even a small reduction in the number of potentially infectious contacts (as a response to the epidemic) can remarkably affect the infection spread. In particular, the earlier the warning about the epidemic appears, the larger the possible reduction of the peak prevalence, and of the final epidemic size. Moreover, the epidemic spread is delayed if individuals' perception of risk is based on a memory mechanism and the risk of infection is initially overestimated. In conclusion, this analysis allows noteworthy inferences about the role of risk perception and the effectiveness of spontaneous behavioral changes during an emerging epidemic. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..

N2  - Due to the omnipresent risk of epidemics, insect societies have evolved sophisticated disease defences at the individual and colony level. An intriguing yet little understood phenomenon is that social contact to pathogen-exposed individuals reduces susceptibility of previously naive nestmates to this pathogen. We tested whether such social immunisation in Lasius ants against the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae is based on active upregulation of the immune system of nestmates following contact to an infectious individual or passive protection via transfer of immune effectors among group members-that is, active versus passive immunisation. We found no evidence for involvement of passive immunisation via transfer of antimicrobials among colony members. Instead, intensive allogrooming behaviour between naive and pathogen-exposed ants before fungal conidia firmly attached to their cuticle suggested passage of the pathogen from the exposed individuals to their nestmates. By tracing fluorescence-labelled conidia we indeed detected frequent pathogen transfer to the nestmates, where they caused low-level infections as revealed by growth of small numbers of fungal colony forming units from their dissected body content. These infections rarely led to death, but instead promoted an enhanced ability to inhibit fungal growth and an active upregulation of immune genes involved in antifungal defences (defensin and prophenoloxidase, PPO). Contrarily, there was no upregulation of the gene cathepsin L, which is associated with antibacterial and antiviral defences, and we found no increased antibacterial activity of nestmates of fungus-exposed ants. This indicates that social immunisation after fungal exposure is specific, similar to recent findings for individual-level immune priming in invertebrates. Epidemiological modeling further suggests that active social immunisation is adaptive, as it leads to faster elimination of the disease and lower death rates than passive immunisation. Interestingly, humans have also utilised the protective effect of low-level infections to fight smallpox by intentional transfer of low pathogen doses ("variolation" or "inoculation"). © 2012 Konrad et al.

N2  - Livestock movements in Great Britain are well recorded, have been extensively analysed with respect to their role in disease spread, and have been used in real time to advise governments on the control of infectious diseases. Typically, livestock holdings are treated as distinct entities that must observe movement standstills upon receipt of livestock, and must report livestock movements. However, there are currently two dispensations that can exempt holdings from either observing standstills or reporting movements, namely the Sole Occupancy Authority (SOA) and Cattle Tracing System (CTS) Links, respectively. In this report we have used a combination of data analyses and computational modelling to investigate the usage and potential impact of such linked holdings on the size of a Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) epidemic. Our analyses show that although SOAs are abundant, their dynamics appear relatively stagnant. The number of CTS Links is also abundant, and increasing rapidly. Although most linked holdings are only involved in a single CTS Link, some holdings are involved in numerous links that can be amalgamated to form "CTS Chains" which can be both large and geographically dispersed. Our model predicts that under a worst case scenario of "one infected - all infected", SOAs do pose a risk of increasing the size (in terms of number of infected holdings) of a FMD epidemic, but this increase is mainly due to intra-SOA infection spread events. Furthermore, although SOAs do increase the geographic spread of an epidemic, this increase is predominantly local. Whereas, CTS Chains pose a risk of increasing both the size and the geographical spread of the disease substantially, under a worse case scenario. Our results highlight the need for further investigations into whether CTS Chains are transmission chains, and also investigations into intra-SOA movements and livestock distributions due to the lack of current data. © 2012 Crown Copyright.

N2  - Epidemic foci of Plasmodium knowlesi malaria have been identified during the past ten years in Malaysia, in particular in the States of Sarawak and Sabah (Malaysia Borneo), and in the Pahang region (peninsular Malaysia). Based on a review of the available recent international literature, the authors underline the importance of molecular biology examinations, polymerase chain reactions (PCR), performed with primers specific for P. knowlesi, since the current microscopic examination (haemoscope) may fail to distinguish P. knowlesi from Plasmodium malariae, due to the very similar appearance of the two parasites. P. knowlesi has been described as the causal agent of lifethreatening and lethal forms of malaria: its clinical picture is more severe when compared with that of P. malariae, since the disease is characterized by greater parasitaemia, as opposed to that documented in the course of P. malariae disease. The most effective carrier is Anopheles leucosphyrus: this mosquito is attracted by both humans and monkeys. Among primates, the natural hosts of P. knowlesi are Macaca fascicularis and Macaca nemestina, while Saimiri scirea and Macaca mulatta, which cannot become infected in nature, may be useful in experimental models. When underlining the potentially severe evolution, we note the key role played by prompt disease recognition, which is expected to be more straightforward in patients monitored in endemic countries at high risk, but should be carefully implemented for subjects being admitted to hospital in Western countries suffering from the typical signs and symptoms of malaria, after travelling in South-East Asia where they were engaged in excursions in the tropical forest (trekking, and similar outdoor activities). In these cases, the diagnosis should be prompt, and suitable treatment should follow. According to data in the literature, in non-severe cases chloroquine proves very effective against P. knowlesi, achieving the disappearance of signs and symptoms in 96% of cases after only 24 hours after treatment start. In the light of the emerging epidemiological data, P. knowlesi should be added to Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, P. malariae, and Plasmodium falciparum, as the fifth aetiological agent of malaria. During the next few years, it will become mandatory to plan an appropriate surveillance program of the epidemiological evolution, paying also great attention to the clinical features of patients affected by P. knowlesi malaria, which are expected to worsen according to the time elapsed; some studies seem to point out greater severity according to increased parasitaemia, paralleling the increased interhuman infectious passages of the plasmodium.

T1  - Insights from past millennia into climatic impacts on human health and survival
A1  - McMichael A.J. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Climate change poses threats to human health, safety, and survival via weather extremes and climatic impacts on food yields, fresh water, infectious diseases, conflict, and displacement. Paradoxically, these risks to health are neither widely nor fully recognized. Historical experiences of diverse societies experiencing climatic changes, spanning multicentury to single-year duration, provide insights into population health vulnerability - even though most climatic changes were considerably less than those anticipated this century and beyond. Historical experience indicates the following. (i) Long-term climate changes have often destabilized civilizations, typically via food shortages, consequent hunger, disease, and unrest. (ii) Medium-term climatic adversity has frequently caused similar health, social, and sometimes political consequences. (iii) Infectious disease epidemics have often occurred in association with briefer episodes of temperature shifts, food shortages, impoverishment, and social disruption. (iv) Societies have often learnt to cope (despite hardship for some groups) with recurring shorterterm (decadal to multiyear) regional climatic cycles (e.g., El Nino Southern Oscillation) - except when extreme phases occur. (v) The drought-famine-starvation nexus has been the main, recurring, serious threat to health. Warming this century is not only likely to greatly exceed the Holocene's natural multidecadal temperature fluctuations but to occur faster. Along with greater climatic variability, models project an increased geographic range and severity of droughts. Modern societies, although larger, better resourced, and more interconnected than past societies, are less flexible, more infrastructure-dependent, densely populated, and hence are vulnerable. Adverse historical climate-related health experiences underscore the case for abating human-induced climate change.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to link transmission dynamics with a probabilistic risk model to provide a mechanistically explicit assessment for estimating the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) infection risk in regions of Taiwan. Method(s): A relative fitness (RF)-based MDR TB model was used to describe transmission, validated with disease data for the period 2006-2010. A dose-response model quantifying by basic reproduction number (R0) and total proportion of infected population was constructed to estimate the site-specific MDR TB infection risk. Result(s): We found that the incidence rate of MDR TB was highest in Hwalien County (4.91 per 100 000 population) in eastern Taiwan, with drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant R0 estimates of 0.89 (95% CI 0.23-2.17) and 0.38 (95% CI 0.05-1.30), respectively. The predictions were in apparent agreement with observed data in the 95% credible intervals. Our simulation showed that the incidence of MDR TB will be falling by 2013-2016. Our results indicated that the selected regions of Taiwan had only ~1% probability of exceeding 50% of the population with infection attributed to MDR TB. Conclusion(s): Our study found that the ongoing control programs implemented in Taiwan may succeed in curing most patients with MDR TB and will reduce the TB incidence countrywide. © 2012 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

N2  - Rapidly spreading infectious diseases are a serious risk to public health. The dynamics and the factors causing outbreaks of these diseases can be better understood using mathematical models, which are fit to data. Here we investigate the dynamics of a Hepatitis E outbreak in the Kitgum region of northern Uganda during 2007 to 2009. First, we use the data to determine that R0 is approximately 2.25 for the outbreak. Secondly, we use a model to estimate that the critical level of latrine and bore hole coverages needed to eradicate the epidemic is at least 16% and 17% respectively. Lastly, we further investigate the relationship between the co-infection factor for malaria and Hepatitis E on the value of R0 for Hepatitis E. Taken together, these results provide us with a better understanding of the dynamics and possible causes of Hepatitis E outbreaks. © 2012 Nannyonga et al.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Personal belief exemptions (PBEs) from mandated school entry vaccinations have increased in California over the past decade. Infectious disease outbreaks in the state may be associated with the aggregation of intentionally unvaccinated children within schools. We sought to quantify the exposure of California kindergartners to children with PBEs at school. We used cross-sectional California Department of Public Health data on 3 kindergarten cohorts to define and calculate multiple measures of exposure to children with exemptions, including interaction and aggregation indices, for the state as a whole (2008-2010) and by county (2010). In 2010, the PBE rate in California was 2.3 per 100 students, and the school PBE rate for the average kindergartner with a PBE was 15.6 per 100. More than 7000 kindergartners in California attend schools with PBE rates greater than 20 per 100, including 2700 kindergartners with PBEs. Exposure measures vary considerably across counties. Our results suggest increasing levels of exposure among kindergarten students in California to other kindergartners with PBEs. Our data provide a concrete set of metrics through which public health and education officials can identify high-risk areas as targets for policy and programmatic interventions.

N2  - Background.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 20.9 million norovirus infections annually in the United States. Although the acute disease burden is sizeable, emerging data suggest norovirus may be associated with chronic gastrointestinal problems. We identified known outbreaks in US military recruits and used the Defense Medical Encounter Database (DMED) to identify the risk of new onset functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGD) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).Methods.Subjects reporting for care of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) at a military treatment clinic during 3 known norovirus outbreaks were identified. Each AGE subject was matched with up to 4 subjects with unrelated medical encounters. Medical encounter data were analyzed for the duration of military service time (or a minimum of 1 year) to assess for incident FGD or GERD. Relative risks were calculated using regression models.Results.We identified 1718 subjects from 3 outbreaks. After controlling for important demographic covariates, the incidence of constipation, dyspepsia, and GERD was approximately 1.5-old higher (P <. 01) in AGE-exposed subjects than matched subjects. We also noted variability in outcome incidence across outbreaks.Conclusions.It appears that the risk of dyspepsia, constipation, and GERD are higher among those who have AGE during a confirmed norovirus outbreak. Although these findings need confirmation, they suggest that dysmotility may result subsequent to these infections. If confirmed, the costs and morbidity associated with the chronic consequences of norovirus should be considered. © The Author 2012.

T1  - Estimating Absolute and Relative Case Fatality Ratios from Infectious Disease Surveillance Data

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Knowing which populations are most at risk for severe outcomes from an emerging infectious disease is crucial in deciding the optimal allocation of resources during an outbreak response. The case fatality ratio (CFR) is the fraction of cases that die after contracting a disease. The relative CFR is the factor by which the case fatality in one group is greater or less than that in a second group. Incomplete reporting of the number of infected individuals, both recovered and dead, can lead to biased estimates of the CFR. We define conditions under which the CFR and the relative CFR are identifiable. Furthermore, we propose an estimator for the relative CFR that controls for time-varying reporting rates. We generalize our methods to account for elapsed time between infection and death. To demonstrate the new methodology, we use data from the 1918 influenza pandemic to estimate relative CFRs between counties in Maryland. A simulation study evaluates the performance of the methods in outbreak scenarios. An R software package makes the methods and data presented here freely available. Our work highlights the limitations and challenges associated with estimating absolute and relative CFRs in practice. However, in certain situations, the methods presented here can help identify vulnerable subpopulations early in an outbreak of an emerging pathogen such as pandemic influenza. © 2012, The International Biometric Society.

T1  - Tuberculosis in developing countries
T3  - 11th International Congress on Pediatric Pulmonology. Bangkok Thailand.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Tuberculosis impacts children severely and severally causing serious and significant morbidity among children, particularly in the high burden developing countries. Despite this, childhood TB does not get any significant attention in the national strategies for TB control as these cases are often not infectious. The difficulties in establishing the diagnosis further make it hard to include children in national surveillance. Though significant improvements have been made in tuberculosis (TB) management under the World Health Organisation's (WHO) directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS) strategy, childhood TB continues to be relatively neglected. Lately, there has been a renewed interest in paediatric tuberculosis as it is acknowledged to constitute a substantial burden of the global TB caseload. This paper provides an overview of traditional and novel approaches used to diagnose and manage childhood TB in resource-limited regions. What is the likely burden of childhood TB? During the decade of nineties, WHO initially estimated that approximately 650,000 TB cases were occurring in children and later a prediction was made that by 2000 this figure would have increased to more than one million childhood cases, making up 10% of all cases [1]. Data from the WHO reflecting 2002 regional notification rates of smearpositive cases among children ranged from 0 per 100,000 persons in Europe to 6 per 100,000 in Africa and 43 and 45 per 100,000 in South Africa and Zambia, respectively [2]. This is certainly a gross underestimate as about 95% of children less than 12 years of age are AFB smear-negative. More recent estimates suggest that Childhood TB contributes approximately 15 to 20% of all cases, increasing to up to 40% in some high TB burden countries [3]. Controlling Infectiousness (read as curing positive sputum smear cases) has been central to all TB control activities and most children being sputum smear negative get excluded from the routine surveillance tools This happens despite the fact the young children carry the greatest burden of disease among all infected individuals. Not only are they most likely to develop disease once infected, they are also significantly more likely to develop extrapulmonary and severe disseminated disease as compared to adults. Two of the most severe manifestations of tuberculosis, miliary disease and tuberculous meningitis, are significantly more common in children. Miliary disease, an early complication of primary infection, occurs following haemotogenous dissemination and is often associated with crippling tubercular meningitis. It is also important to point out that in developing communities a large proportion of the population is aged less than 15 years and as many as 40% of tuberculosis notifications may be from children; tuberculosis may be responsible for 10% or more of childhood hospital admissions and 10% or more of hospital deaths [4]. Furthermore, with an annual risk of infection of 2-3%, close to 40% of the population may be infected by age 15 years. Children with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) are the reservoir of future disease in adulthood, perpetuating the epidemic. Childhood TB is also a sentinel event, indicating ongoing transmission of TB within communities. The HIV epidemic, which disproportionately affects young adults, many of whom are co-infected with TB, may also put their children at particularly high risk of infection. In wealthier, low-burden countries, infected children are often identified by contact tracing and given chemoprophylaxis, but limited resources and a much higher disease incidence prohibit this in most high burden settings. Even though the preventive Isoniazid (INH) therapy can substantively reduce the risk of disease amongst infected individual but this effect gets less profound in high prevalence situations since the benefit is not carried over for not so uncommon subsequent infections. While there are enough reasons to keep childhood TB as much in focus in TB control activities as other groups, yet the mismatch between available resources and need to decrease the high burden of the infectious cases often leaves them out. How is the diagnosis established for childhood TB conditions? Mycobacterial staining and culture in body specimens is the gold standard for diagnosis of TB at all age groups. However, the lack of sensitivity and specificity of these tests in childhood tuberculosis makes establishing diagnosis a challenging task. The difficulty in accessing the correct specimen in small children has made this important test less popular with most practicing paediatricians. The diagnosis of tuberculosis in children is more often based on ancillary evidence like exposure or contact history, prolonged symptoms, tuberculin skin test and chest radiography. Suspecting Tuberculosis: The symptoms of TB disease are chronic in nature and are non-specific. Typically fever and or cough for more than 2 weeks duration, unexplained weight loss and or anorexia, painless superficial lymphadenopathy are seen in cases with tuberculosis. The lack of specificity and frequency with which these symptoms occur without TB among children in poor countries makes the clinical diagnosis imprecise. A better characterisation of the symptoms can add further to the specificity of these and thus aid the diagnosis. Typically the cough and fever in TB are persistent and unremitting [5]. A reduced sensitivity in symptom-based TB diagnosis has been observed in younger children (<3 years of age) and those co-infected with HIV. TB disease may be characterized by acute symptoms in these settings. In another study when comparing the symptoms of children with culture proven TB to those who were initially suspected of having TB but shown to have other lung diseases it was shown that weight loss, chronic cough, duration of symptoms or weight less than the third percentile did not differ between the two groups. The only clinical factors which differentiated between the groups were contact with an adult index case and a positive tuberculin skin test [6]. The symptoms may also vary a little with the type and site of involvement. The most common symptoms of pleural effusion are chest pain, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and anorexia. The findings on physical examination can mimic bacterial pneumonia, with dullness to percussion, diminished breath sounds, and fever. Secondary (post-primary) pulmonary TB disease usually presents during adolescence and is most common in areas endemic for TB. Symptoms like weight loss, fever, productive cough, hemoptysis, and night sweats are commonly seen. Typically the findings on physical examination may be minimal. Chest Radiology: Chest roentgengraph is the commonest diagnostic tool used in evaluating patients for pulmonary tuberculosis. It is not only difficult to get a technically valid, well exposed and wellcentered chest skaigram in a young child, its interpretation can also be erroneous due the problems of subjectivity in reading and reader variability. Despite all its inadequacies, the chest roentgenogram remains the most widely used diagnostic test in clinical practice. The chest radiographic findings diagnostic of intrathoracic TB are enlarged mediastinal glands and complications resulting from the glands compressing airways or other structures. On plain radiographs, hilar lymphadenopathy is best seen on a posteroanterior radiograph as a lobulated density but can also be viewed in lateral films posterior to the bronchus intermedius as a "dough nut" sign. Lateral films can improve the accuracy of diagnosis by detecting hilar adenitis not clearly appreciated on frontal films. Lateral chest radiographs improve the diagnostic yield by 11% [7]. Fluoroscopy of the main airways helps differentiate the presence of hilar adenopathy (which remains immobile throughout respiration) from prominent pulmonary vasculature. In studies of culture-proven TB, adenopathy is visible in 49 to 60% of chest skiagrams. A calcified lesion found in the parenchyma of the lungs indicates an old granuloma. TB may present only with alveolar opacification making it difficult to distinguish from other causes of pneumonia. Common parenchymal changes seen in a child with TB include alveolar consolidation, pleural effusion, segmental hyperinflation, atelectasis, or a focal mass. Miliary TB has the only distinct radiologically diagnostic feature of TB disease- characterized by fine bilateral reticular shadowing, sometimes called a snowstorm appearance. Adolescents can present with adult-type reactivation disease. Radiographic features of post primary disease include patchy, poorly defined consolidation or inhomogenous alveolar opacities, particularly in the upper lobes; and, cavitations (about half of the patients) in the absence of lymphadenopathy. Post primary disease usually occurs in the apical, posterior segments of the upper lobes and apical segment of the lower lobe because the oxygen tension is highest in the upper lung zones. Bronchogenic spread is radiographically identified in 20% of cases of TB reactivation, manifested as multiple, ill-defined micronodules, involving the lower zones of the lungs, usually distant from the site of cavitation. As most of the radiological appearances are not specific to tuberculosis and the interpretation of the radiological findings suffers from both inter- and intra-individual variations, the over- and under-diagnosis is quite common. Computed tomography (CT) imaging can be helpful in a symptomatic child with a normal CXR or an asymptomatic TST or IGRA positive child with equivocal findings on CXR. Intravenous contrast medium is used to distinguish lymph nodes from normal blood vessels. However, CT scan of the chest is not routinely recommended due to cost, lack of specificity and high radiation.

N2  - Background Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases pose a potential threat to blood safety, and require decisions on implementation of protective measures. The browser-based European Up-Front Risk Assessment Tool (EUFRAT) provides quantitative, fast and flexible risk estimates for public health decision makers across the five steps of the transfusion chain from the risk of infection in the population to the risk to recipients of blood products. EUFRAT therefore has broad application potential. It was developed by the University of Utrecht for the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) to support decision making for blood safety in outbreak situations. Methods EUFRAT is a modelling tool that reflects both characteristics of an infectious disease and the transfusion practice. It can be used with any blood-borne infectious disease but contains specific parameters for 18 diseases of outbreak potential in Europe, including West Nile Virus, tick-borne encephalitis, hepatitis A, Q fever and malaria. Users apply population, outbreak and disease-specific data to estimate risk outputs for specific outbreak areas, as well as the associated risks from a traveller returning from an outbreak area. Infection risks in five subsequent steps in the blood transfusion chain are assessed: (1) the risk of infection in the donor population, (2) the risk of infected donations, (3) components, (4) end products, and (5) the risk of transmitting the infection to recipients. EUFRAT allows inputs to be point estimates or ranges, and uses Monte-Carlo simulation for ranges. Results The tool has been applied to outbreaks of infectious diseases in Europe in 2012 to validate the modelling, and it is foreseen to enter a pilot phase in 2013. Conclusion EUFRAT is a user-friendly, flexible tool that provides quantitative risk assessments not currently found in other models, and support guidance and decision making towards maintaining blood safety during outbreaks of infectious diseases in Europe.

N2  - Background: Bacterial enterocolitis is associated with an increased risk of developing pi-IBS with a mean incidence of 9.8%. Factors associated with increased risk of subsequent IBS include duration and severity (e.g. bloody diarrhea) of the preceding gastroenteritis, and psychosocial factors. Hence, the incidence of pi-IBS after a severe EHEC-outbreak is likely to be higher than previously reported. In May/June 2011, an outbreak of EHEC O104:H4 affected a total of 3842 patients with hemorrhagic enterocolitis mostly in Northern Germany. 855 of these EHEC patients developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and 53 died. Thus, this was the severest EHEC outbreak ever noted worldwide. Aim(s): To estimate the incidence of pi-IBS after 6 months in a cohort of patients affected by the EHEC O104:H4 outbreak in Hamburg and to prospectively identify associated somatic and psychometric factors. Method(s): In May/June 2011, 181 patients currently treated in the university hospital of Hamburg with acute EHEC disease were contacted to participate in the study, that was approved by the local ethics committee. At time-point t0, i.e. during acute EHEC disease, patients were asked to fill in questionnaires regarding the current EHEC disease, its complications and therapies, as well as multiple psychometric factors and, retrospectively, the IBS Rome III criteria at the time before EHEC. At time-point t1, 6 months after EHEC, participants fill in questionnaires containing somatic follow-up of EHEC complications, IBS Rome III and psychometric factors. Statistics include frequencies with 95% CI and logistic regression models to assess predictor variables. Result(s): 151 patients (70 % women; mean age of 43 +/- 16) participate in the study. At baseline, 88% of the patients had bloody diarrhea with a median duration of 6.5 days. 26.4% suffered from HUS. Mean scores for anxiety and depression were significantly higher compared to the general population. As abstract submission deadline falls into t1 (6 months after EHEC), data acquisition for t1 is currently ongoing. Data on the incidence of pi-IBS and associated risk factors will be available in January 2012. Conclusion(s): 151 patients affected by the severest EHEC outbreak ever noted worldwide are being prospectively followed regarding the incidence of pi-IBS after 6 months and the identification of associated somatic and psychometric risk factors. The extensive database on these patients includes a broad spectrum of information regarding course, complications and therapies of the EHEC disease, a variety of psychometric factors before, during and 6 months after EHEC disease and IBS Rome III status before and 6 months after EHEC disease. Data acquisition at t1 is currently ongoing. Data on the incidence of pi-IBS 6 months after EHEC and associated risk factors will be available in January 2012. Work in progress.

N2  - Background: Dengue viruses (DENV 1-4) pose a risk to the safe transfusion of blood, with confirmed reports of transfusion-transmission from Hong Kong and Singapore. In Australia, episodic outbreaks occur on a seasonal basis in North Eastern Australia; the 2008/2009 epidemic was the largest in this region in over 50 years, with over 1000 confirmed clinical cases. Given the absence of an approved blood screening test, the Australian Red Cross Blood Service restricts fresh component manufacture from at risk donors during these outbreaks. The use of Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT), such as the Mirasol PRT System for Platelets treated in PAS, may be an alternative approach for blood services to manage the risk of DENV transfusiontransmission. Aim(s): This study aimed to examine the ability of the Mirasol PRT System for Platelets treated in PAS to inactivate DENV (1-4) in buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates in additive solution. Method(s): Buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates in additive solution (SSP+) were spiked with DENV 1-4 (7.17-8.01 log gEq/ml; four to five units per DENV serotype) then treated with the Mirasol. A pre- and post-PRT treatment sample was taken and the level of DENV infectivity was determined by plaque assay. The reduction in viral infectivity between pre- and post-treatment was calculated to determine the effect of the inactivation process. Result(s): Treatment with PRT (Mirasol) resulted in the inactivation of all four DENV serotypes. The greatest amount of inactivation was observed for DENV-4 (1.81 log reduction; 98.5% reduction) followed by DENV-3 (1.71 log reduction; 98.1% reduction), DENV-2 (1.45 log reduction; 96.5% reduction) then DENV-1 (1.28 log reduction; 94.7% reduction). Summary/conclusions: The levels of viral inactivation were lower than expected and lower than what is observed for similar viruses, such as West Nile Virus. Our study shows that treatment of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates in additive solution with PRT (Mirasol) yields a reduction of infectious levels of DENV at low levels. The relevance of the amounts required to prevent disease transmission by transfusion have not been fully defined. The significance of these low reduction levels relative to protection against transfusion transmitted disease are thus not fully understood at this time but clearly requires further evaluation and assessment.

N2  - Background: Increasing identification of transfusion transmission (TT) of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) raised the awareness that there may be more EIDs posing a potential risk for blood transfusion safety. In order to allow countries to evaluate the potential threats of the EID, a timely risk assessment is deemed essential to support necessary safety measures to prevent such transmission. Aim(s): To develop a model that allows a timely assessment of the TT risk to blood safety during an EID outbreak, namely the European Up-Front Risk Assessment Tool (EUFRAT). Method(s): A generic model to assess TT risk during an EID outbreak was developed that reflects epidemiological characteristics of an EID and the transfusion practice. Infection risks in five subsequent steps in the blood transfusion chain are assessed: (i) the risk of obtaining infection in the donor population, (ii) the risk of collecting infected donations, (iii) infected components, (iv) infected end products, and (v) the risk of transmitting the infection (to recipients. The model was applied to data from a recent chikungunya outbreak in Italy. At the peak of the outbreak (week 11), 175 cases were identified in a population of 3,977,508. The infectious periods are 2 and 8 days (range: 1-12 days) for the symptomatically and asymptomatically infected individuals, respectively. There are 140,216 donors that donate whole blood on average twice a year. It was assumed that 85% of the infected individuals develop symptoms, donors have a similar risk of getting infected as the general population, the infected donations remain infectious to transfusion recipients, and 0.1% of the infected recipients develop acute severe disease manifestations. Several intervention scenarios were analyzed, among others the effects of increasing the duration of the quarantine period of blood donations on the recipient risk of acquiring infection (Table 1). Also, the risk coming from a donor who visited the outbreak area and then donated blood in his home country is assessed. Result(s): An assessment at the peak of the outbreak resulted in an estimated prevalence of 1.07 (95% CI, 0.38-2.03) and 0.39 (95% CI, 0.15-0.71) per 100,000 and 0.04 (95% CI, 0.01-0.1) and 0.2 (95% CI, 0.002-0.06) infected donations using weekly and cumulative notified cases respectively; this number of viremic donations is expected to become zero after at least 7 days of quarantine. The estimates lead to 0.13 and 0.05 infected blood components (step 3), 0.13 and 0.05 infected end products (step 4), and 0.0001 and 0.00005 severe infections in recipients (step 5). The probability of a donor who visited the area for 1 week during the peak of the outbreak donating infectious blood 1 day after returning to his home country is estimated to be 0.30 (95% CI, 0.01- 0.65) per 100,000. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): The generic EUFRAT model can be applied to quantify the TT risks of chikungunya and other EIDs for various safety measures using a limited amount of information concerning the pathogen and outbreak data and as such support transfusion regulators and public health decision making.

N2  - Background: The Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands, which started in 2007 and peaked in 2009, prompted the public health authorities to take measures including implementing donations screening to ensure blood transfusion safety. A timely risk assessment would have allowed transfusion regulators to decide when and where the screening should be targeted. The EUFRAT model provides risk estimates across the five steps of the transfusion chain from the risk of infection in the donor population to the risk to recipients of blood products. It was developed to support decision making for blood safety in outbreak situations. Aim(s): To assess the transfusion transmission risks of Q fever during the outbreak in the Netherlands using two independent data sources. Method(s): Notification data from highly affected areas collected during the peak of the outbreak was extracted. In that area with a population of 86,000 inhabitants, 566 Q fever cases were reported in the study period May 2009 until May 2010. As approximately 40% of infected individuals present with symptoms around 60% of cases remain unreported. Infection risks in five subsequent steps in the blood transfusion chain are assessed: (i) the risk of a donor being infectious, (ii) the risk of collecting infected donations, (iii) infected components, (iv) infected end products, and (v) the risk of transmitting the infection to recipients. The prevalence of infection, which determines the risk of a donor being infectious, is estimated from the number of cases reported amongst the exposed population during the assessment period, accounting for the infectious period and the proportion of unreported cases. Estimation of the number of infected donations and the subsequent risk for transfusion recipients involve a detailed blood processing procedure. The prevalence and the number of infected donations as estimated using the EUFRAT model are compared with the results of blood donation screening implemented by Sanquin, where three serum samples from 762 donors collected from corresponding study area and period were tested positive for presence of antibodies against C. burnetii by IFA. Result(s): We estimated a prevalence of Q fever infection amongst donors of 78.44 (95% CI, 51-105.3) per 100,000. This prevalence resulted in 0.33 (95% CI, 0.09-0.72) infected donations. These estimates are lower than the results of the blood screening study of 389.8 per 100,000 and 0.55 respectively. The lower prevalence estimate might be due to a higher proportion of unreported cases than just the proportion of asymptomatic cases. If donors (2% of the total population) donate whole blood on average 1.75 per donor per year and each donation is processed into three components or products with various residual infectivity, the estimates lead to 0.99 (95% CI, 0.27-2.16) infected blood components (step 3), 0.57 (95% CI, 0.27-1.80) infected end products (step 4), and 0.06 (95% CI, 0.03-0.18) chronic infections in recipients (step 5). Conclusion(s): We quantify the transfusion transmission risks of Q fever outbreak using the EUFRAT model. The donation screening study validates our results. The model can support transfusion regulators to decide when and where necessary measures should be targeted during outbreak situations.

N2  - Cases of childhood leukemia very rarely present as a significant time/space cluster. Clusters offer a unique opportunity to identify a point source causal exposure but, in practice, this is extremely difficult. We herewith report an apparent cluster of seven cases of childhood B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) occurring over a four week period (December 2009/January 2010) in Milan, Lombardy, Italy. Over the prior ten years (1999-2008), the mean number of cases per year in Milan was 7.3+/-1.3. The seven cases in the cluster were of varying ages at diagnosis (2-11 years); analysis of chromosomal abnormalities did not reveal recurrent features; inherited leukemia associated alleles did not show an augmented risk. Given the protracted natural history of ALL, initiated in utero, and the variable ages at diagnosis in this cluster, an exposure to a causal trigger or promotional factor focused proximally to the diagnostic time frame was suspected. Three cases attended one school and a fourth was the younger sibling of a student at this same school. No cases of leukemia were recorded in the previous ten years at the school. All four cases lived in the same small area of Milan. A space-time permutation scan statistic was applied to the whole series of data and revealed a clustering for the one month period of diagnosis and the small city area of the four cases (p-value=0.017). As the school had undergone extensive refurbishment 3-24 months prior to the diagnoses, exposure to chemicals and physical agents (including EMF) as well as leukemogenic paint solvents was considered but no supportive evidence for this was obtained. An outbreak of the AH1N1 influenza virus pandemic occurred in Milan 8-10 weeks prior to the diagnoses. All seven cases of ALL were later found to be AH1N1 antibody-positive, in contrast to 32.3% (95% confidence interval: 26,96% - 37,96%) of age-matched children in Milan. Interestingly, positivity was found in only one out of four children from Lombardy with kidney tumor for whom we could retrieve PB collected at that time. Additionally, all seven cases had features indicative of a likely paucity of infectious exposure in the first year of life (high birth order and lack of social contacts). These data do not establish causality but are compatible with the 'delayed infection' hypothesis for childhood ALL in which an abnormal immune or inflammatory response to a common infection promotes ALL in susceptible individuals (Greaves M., Nat Rev Cancer, 2006;6:193-203). This is the first time that a significant cluster of childhood leukemia cases has been linked, albeit tentatively, to a known infectious agent. Prior, descriptive epidemiological data have however indicated an association between increased rates of childhood ALL and epidemics of seasonal influenza in the UK (Kroll ME et al, J Natl Cancer Inst, 2006;98:417-20). The credibility of flu viruses as potential triggers of ALL requires further exploration including functional assessment in model systems.

N2  - Introduction and Objectives: An outbreak of the Enterohemorrhagic E. coli O111 occurred in Japan in April-May 2011. On 26 April 2011, Takaoka Public Health Center (PHC) in Toyama prefecture received a case suspected of EHEC and the person had visited the Takaoka branch of a barbecue restaurant chain A (BBQ chain A). In the next day, the center confirmed EHEC O111 in patient's stool culture. Since then, multiple PHCs and local governments in Toyama and neighbouring prefectures received reports of not only EHEC O111 and/or O157 but also several cases of HUS from customers of several BBQ chain A restaurants. The EHECs' strain had the same pattern for PFGE, and that confirmed occurrence of widespread outbreak. The Toyama prefectural government requested the Field Epidemiology Team of NIID to start the investigation on 4 May. Our main objective is to perform a thorough investigation to reveal the full picture of this outbreak. Material(s) and Method(s): Records of clinical information and food consumption regarding BBQ Chain A were collected through the PHCs' investigation, based on the Infectious Disease Control Law and the Food Sanitation Act. Laboratory tests were operated by the Toyama Prefectural Institute of Public Health. We conducted a casecontrol study. The case was defined as a person presenting with one or more gastroenteritis symptoms (diarrhea, bloody stool, abdominal pain, vomiting) or diagnosed with HUS AND isolated EHEC O111 and/or O157 or a detected O111 antibody. The control was a person who had eaten at the BBQ chain A but didn't have any symptoms and didn't detected any EHECs. Risk factors for the EHEC infection were estimated by logistics regression analysis. Result(s): We had 89 confirmed cases and 146 controls. The ratio of females in cases were 53% (47/89). The onset date were distributed between 19 April and 7 May, the date with highest numbers of patients were 26 and 25April (19 cases). The date that patients visited restaurants was distributed between 17 and 24 April, and 40 cases ate at the specific branch on 23 April. Most cases had symptoms such as diarrhea (89%) or abdominal pain (80%). The median age of cases was 20 years old (range: 1-70). There were 32 HUS cases (36%); and five of them were fatal (case fatality rate: 6%). Among cases that had detailed consumption records, a raw beef menu was consumed by 100% (82/82) and that was significantly associated with illness (OR = 59.8, 95% CI: 8.1-441.5). Conclusion(s): Our investigations identified the raw beef menu as the most likely vehicle of this outbreak, but lack of records for trace-backs prevented us to point out the precise source of infection. Consumers were notified the risk of raw meat by this incident, and that lead the national government to revise and tighten regulations for meat providers and restaurants that serve raw beef menu.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the incidence and distribution of infectious diseases which have been markedly affected by climate change. METHOD(S): Literature searches were performed using Embase, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and WHO website. RESULT(S): Current evidence suggests that inter-annual and inter-decadal climate variability have a direct impact on the epidemiology of infectious diseases. According to WHO, since mid-1970s, climatic changes have caused annually over 150 000 deaths and an approximately 5 million disability-adjusted life-years, mainly in developing countries. Malaria has been considered as an extremely climate-sensitive disease. A temperature rise of 2degreeC-3degreeC increases the risk of malaria by 3%-5%. Across the world, the incidence cases of malaria increased from 233 000 in 2000 to 244 000 in 2005, with highest incidence observed in Africa. The West Nile virus (WNV) disease is considered as an emerging epidemic in the US. More than 7000 neuroinvasive WNV disease cases were reported in the US from 1999-2004. Parallel to rising temperatures, the US has recorded a 41% increase in vibrio infection rate from 1996-2006. In continental Europe, a temperature rise of 6degreeC above the mean resulted in an estimated 30% reported cases of salmonellosis. In Russia, rising temperatures from 2001 have increased the incidence of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) by 10-fold within a decade. Korea's climatic variability has also been positively correlated with the incidence cases of malaria, Vibrio vulnificus sepsis, scrub typhus, leptospirosis, and Hantavirus infection during 2001-2008. Further, in 2009- 2010, government officials of Europe have predicted that borreliosis, WNV fever, TBE, and salmonellosis are likely to be majorly affected by climate change. CONCLUSION(S): Accelerating climate change carries a profound threat for the increased burden of infectious diseases worldwide. To attain the maximum disease prevention, an understanding of the ecology of infectious diseases must be developed in order to protect vulnerable populations, rather than focussing on single agent of disease.

N2  - Impact on CF Treatment/Care: The routes by which the traditional cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogens, (e.g., P. aeruginosa, Burkholderia spp) and other pathogens (e.g., S. aureus, other multidrug resistant bacteria, atypical mycobacteria) are acquired are incompletely understood. This presentation will reviewcurrent information about the role of the inanimate environment in transmission of CF pathogens from a) the natural environment; b) surfaces and water in the home and healthcare facilities; and c) medical equipment and solutions.An understanding of the extent to which organisms in the environment may pose a threat to patients with CF and methods of preventing transmission will reduce the risk of acquiring virulent pathogens and improve outcomes. It is important to demonstrate transmission from a source to a patient in addition to isolation of a specific pathogen from an inanimate source. CF Pathogens in the Natural Environment: Strict infection control measures to prevent patient-to-patient transmission of Burkholderia spp have reduced but not eliminated infection with certain strains. Acquisition of distinct strains now accounts for the majority of new Burkholderia infections. Some Burkholderia spp are recognized plant pathogens. In 1999-2000, B. cenocepacia isolates recovered from soil samples from NewYork state agricultural fields that had been planted with onions for several years were indistinguishable from the B. cenocepacia strain thatwas shared by many patients with CF in the mid- Atlantic region (1). Subsequently, these strains were also found in other cities in the US and Europe and were indistinguishable from isolates from patients with CF (2). Burkholderia spp have also been found in rice, wheat and maize rhizospheres, industrial settings, and human sewage. Of note, the species of Burkholderia found most frequently in the natural environment are found infrequently in CF patients. In contrast, B. multivorans is isolated frequently from CF patients, but only rarely from the environment. P. aeruginosa is widely distributed in the natural environment, mostly in aquatic habitats. Most strains found in aquatic environments are not the same as CF patient strains, with the exception of P. aeruginosa clone C (3). CF Pathogens on Surfaces and in Products in the Patient's Environment Healthcare facilities. Most studies of hospital inpatient and outpatient environments do not find a reservoir for shared strains. Although P. aeruginosa was isolated in 19% of surface samples of showers after hospitalized colonized patients had washed, environmental strains were different from clinical strains and no P. aeruginosa was detected before washing (4). In one study of a CF center with a high patient colonization rate with the more virulent Liverpool strain, patient clothes, bed linens, and external surfaces of the patients' personal respiratory therapy equipment were infrequently and transiently colonized (5). Another study of bacterial surface contamination in 7 different CF clinics found that respiratory tract pathogens were recovered from only 1% of inanimate surfaces in the area of patients known to be colonized with those pathogens, most often from receptionists' counters, bathroom faucets and waiting room chairs; pulse oximeters and stethoscopes were rarely contaminated (6). In contrast, one study from 2001-2005 recovered P. aeruginosa from 23% of samples from inanimate surfaces, mostly from sinks and drains. Twenty percent of the environmental isolates were genotyped and compared with clinical isolates: 19 of the 21 environmental strains were found to be genetically related to the clinical strains. In this study, it was estimated that each patient who was not colonized with P. aeruginosa had a 5.4% risk of coming into contact with a surface colonized with P. aeruginosa at each clinic visit (7). Although an early study of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in patients with CF suggested the potential for acquisition from inanimate surfaces in contact with water, a more recent study demonstrated that isolates associated with persistent colonization of water, traps, and sinks were different from clinical isolates (8). The variations in these study results may, in part, reflect variations in cleaning and disinfection practices in CF centers. In conclusion, studies to date support the recommendations for surface cleaning and disinfection, but indicate that inanimate environmental contamination is a less frequent source of new acquisition of pathogens. Contaminated products. Burkholderia spp are the most frequently isolated bacteria in non-sterile and sterile pharmaceutical products that have been recalled. There have been many healthcare-associated outbreaks of Burkholderia infections associated with contaminated skin antiseptics, mouthwash, medications, medical devices, etc., that could serve as a source of Burkholderia spp in CF patients (9). Although there are no published reports of proven acquisition by CF patients from such products, such sources present a risk for patients with CF. Also, multi-dose vials of medications, especially albuterol, should not be used for >1 patient and unit dose vials are preferred even for the same patient due to outbreaks that have occurred after contamination of medication vials. Homes. Similarly, studies of the home environment of patients with CF have isolated P. aeruginosa from environmental samples, mostly in bathrooms, but only rarely are the genotypes of patient strains and environmental strains the same. It is likely that the contamination that occurs is from the patient to the environment, which may be of particular concern for multiple patient families. Thus, reasonable surface cleaning and disinfection will likely continue to be recommended, but should not be the primary focus of infection prevention efforts in the home. CF pathogens recovered from respiratory therapy equipment. The most challenging question about the role of the inanimate environment in transmission is the optimal management of nebulizers and other respiratory therapy equipment, both in the home and in healthcare facilities. Nebulizers are classified as semi-critical items because they come into contact with mucous membranes, but do not penetrate body surfaces. Several studies have recovered CF pathogens from nebulizers and contamination of nebulizers was associated with transmission and therefore, cleaning, disinfecting, rinsing and air drying after each use was recommended in the 2003 guideline for home and in hospitals. Studies of nebulizer care published since the 2003 have found: a) frequent failure to follow recommended practices; b) contamination with CF pathogens when recommended practices are not followed; c) failure of vinegar (acetic acid) to remove S. aureus and E. coli; d) no advantage of hypochlorite based solutions; e) failure to find microbial contamination of the cup of disposable nebulizers after 24 hours; therefore, consideration may be given to disposal of a nebulizer after 24 hours of use when in hospital (10). Recommendations for care of nebulizers and pulmonary function test equipment will be a priority for the current literature review and guideline update. Use of cleaning - monitoring protocols. There are now several published reports that demonstrate the benefit for preventing transmission of infectious agents of a) educating personnel who are responsible for cleaning healthcare facility surfaces and b) monitoring the cleaning process using objective measures, (e.g., fluorescent marker systems, ATP bioluminescence assay) (11,12). Use of monitoring systems with feedback to the staff members may be beneficial for baseline and post-intervention assessments in ambulatory and inpatient areas where patients with CF receive care.

T1  - Update on infection control guidelines: Patient-to-patient transmission of CF pathogens
T3  - 26th Annual North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference. Orlando, FL United States.
T3  - (var.pagings).

N2  - Rationale and Methods for Updating Guidelines: At the time of publication of the Infection Control Guidelines for CF a decade ago (!) [1], the CF Foundation and co-authors made a commitment to update the guidelines as new information became available. Both CF and infection prevention and control (IP&C) are dynamic disciplines that develop new practices in response to new science and identification of new challenges. In addition, the CF Foundation is committed to developing new care guidelines that incorporate the use of systematic reviews and a priori procedures for crafting recommendations developed by consensus [2, 3]. Hence, a committee consisting of representatives from the interdisciplinary CF care team as well as people with CF and parents of people with CF has been convened to update the IP&C Guidelines. Strategies for updating the guidelines include review of relevant studies in CF, incorporation of relevant national guidelines (e.g., the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention and Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee guidelines for Hand Hygiene, Isolation Precautions, and Management of Multidrug Resistant Pathogens, www.cdc.gov/hicpac), and systematic reviews of selected issues if evidence is available. Update on Clinical Impact of CF Pathogens and Patient-to-Patient Transmission: Studies have continued to show the adverse clinical impact of shared strains acquired through patient-to-patient transmission. For example, Aaron et al demonstrated two dominant clones of Pseudomonas aeruginosa among CF patients in Ottawa; one of these clones, found to be genetically identical to the Liverpool epidemic strain [4], was associated with an increased rate of death or lung transplantation within a 3-year observation period [5]. Similarly, patients infected with the same Burkholderia dolosa strain had greater decline in lung function and increased risk of dying [6]. Most recently, patients attending the same CF clinic were found to be infected with the same strain of Mycobacterium abscessus subspecies massiliense [7]. Furthermore, Dasenbrook et al. have shown using CFF registry data that chronic infection with methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was associated with greater decline in lung function and increased mortality [8,9]. Finally, Stone et al. demonstrated that MRSA strains were shared between CF patients and their family members [10]. Continued Importance of Basic IP&C Principles: Hand hygiene remains the most basic intervention to prevent transmission of potential pathogens. While hand hygiene efforts typically focus on health care providers, it is critical that hand hygiene also be performed by people with CF. Zuckerman et al. have demonstrated that the hands of CF patients can become contaminated with their respiratory tract pathogens during CF clinic despite performing hand hygiene at the start of clinic [11]. Notably, Miroballi et al found that 20% of CF patients or their parents reported that their CF care team had not discussed opportunities to perform hand hygiene with them and only 66% reported they had been told to do so after coughing [12]. The use of personal protective equipment (masks, gloves and gowns) has been promulgated as means of preventing transmission of potential pathogens. While gloves and gowns are generally reserved for health care providers caring for patients on Contact Precautions, the use of masks by symptomatic patients, so-called "Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette," has been advocated to prevent transmission of pathogens spread by droplets, such as influenza and SARS, by containing the source of infectious agents [www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/isolation/Isolation2007]. Masks may also play a protective role and prevent acquisition of potential pathogens by non-immune individuals. Notably, in the 2003 IP&C guidelines for CF, consensus for the use of masks by CF patients was an "Unresolved Issue" as available data had not supported their use; transmission of Burkholderia had been halted by implementation of other infection control measures without the use of masks by patients [1]. The IP&C principle Standard Precautions teaches that if a health care provider is likely to be in contact with infectious body fluids, such as respiratory tract secretions, personal protective equipment should be worn, regardless of the known infection/colonization status of a patient. This is because any patient could potentially harbor an unknown transmissible pathogen. This principle is particularly relevant for CF patients as identification of microorganisms from respiratory tract cultures may lag behind true pathogen status, despite appropriate processing by the clinical microbiology laboratory. In addition, our understanding of droplet transmission in CF may be incomplete as suggested by recent observations and experimental systems. While the "3 foot rule" has been advocated as the minimal safe distance between patients intended to minimize droplet transmission, infectious droplets with influenza or coronavirus may travel as far as 6 feet [13]. Furthermore, in a forced cough model, infectious nuclei were generated by CF patients infected with P. aeruginosa and some traveled further than 3 feet [14]. Finally, air may remain contaminated with CF pathogens after patients have left the room. Such observations may have implications for mask use by CF patients, particularly in CF clinics. Special Circumstances: Additional areas for which consensus guidelines will be developed include recommendations for non-healthcare congregate settings in which more than one person with CF may be present such as Great Strides, fund raising events, or pharmaceutical company sponsored events. Finally, the guidelines will also consider the potential role of animals as vectors for pathogens including pet therapy animals, personal pets and farm animals. Next Steps: The IP&C committee will develop evidence based recommendations when feasible and grade them using the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force grading system [15]. Consensus recommendations will be made for areas for which appropriate published guidelines are available or if systematic reviews were not performed due to limited evidence. Public comment from the CF community will be sought prior to finalizing the guidelines.

N2  - Background: Tuberculosis remains as one of the highest unresolved disease burden among re-emerging diseases in Malaysia for the last thirty years. Since 1980 s, Isoniazid Preventive Therapy has been adopted for paediatric population in Malaysia. More recently, it has been extended to the people living with HIV. With current treatment protocol emphasizing among the infectives, we seek to find if combination treatment of these active cases with Isoniazid preventive therapy for other high risk latent tuberculosis infection groups among non-HIV population would give greater impact on reducing incidence. Method(s): This study aims to apply the use of infectious disease modelling to study the progression of latent tuberculosis infection among non-HIV population in Malaysia, and to assess the impact of Isoniazid as preventive therapy on reducing incidence. We present a deterministic compartmental age-structured tuberculosis model which incorporates treatment of infectives as well as the preventive therapy. The model assumes latently infected individuals develop active disease as a result of primary infection, endogenous reactivation and exogenous reinfection. We start by formulating and analyzing the model without any intervention strategy then, we extend to incorporate the preventive therapy and treatment of infectives. The epidemic thresholds known as reproduction numbers and equilibria for the model were determined, and stabilities analyzed. The reproduction numbers for the model were compared to assess the possible community benefits achieved by treatment of infectives, preventive therapy and a holistic approach of combination of both intervention strategies. The model then further quantifies the effectiveness of preventive therapy for early latent tuberculosis infection and demonstrates how effective the therapy has to be to eliminate tuberculosis, when use in conjunction with treatment for active tuberculosis. Result(s): The analysis shows that additional coverage and treatment of infectives among non-HIV population is more effective in the first years of implementation of this preventive therapy as treatment results in clearing active tuberculosis immediately and there after preventive therapy will do better in controlling number of infectives due to reduced progression to infectious state. Conclusion(s): Our model suggests that Isoniazid Preventive Therapy which identify and treat persons recently infected may have a substantial effect on controlling tuberculosis epidemics in Malaysia.

N2  - Background: Influenza is highly infectious with a short incubation period. Travel therefore, can play an important role in the rapid spread of influenza.Weprospectively assessed the attack rate (AR), incidence rate (IR) and risk factors for influenza virus infections among travellers. Method(s): Persons attending a travel clinic in 2006/2007 before departing on short-term travel to developing countries, were invited to participate. Participants kept a structured daily travel diary and donated blood samples before and after travel for influenza serology using the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay. Four vaccine strains representing the circulating epidemic strains, were used. If post-travel titre for influenza showed a >=4- fold increase above pre-travel titre, thiswasconsidered a confirmed influenza infection for the influenza type tested. Patients with pretravel titres >=40 were considered immune. Result(s): Of 1190 respondents, 87% were born in a western country, 43% were male and median age was 37. Median travel duration was 21 days. 46% travelled to Asia; 27% to Latin America and 24% to Africa. The AR of laboratory confirmed influenza was 7.2% (86/1190 travellers), the IR 8.9/100 person-months. The AR of symptomatic infection was 1.4%; the IR 2.0/100 person-months. South-Central and West Asia showed the highest AR and incidence rate ratio (IRR) for symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. The age-groups 35- 44 years and 55-64 years had significantly higher IRR's compared to the age-group <25 years (IRR 2.6 (95%CI:1.1-5.9) and IRR 2.9 (95%CI:1.2-6.7) respectively). Being born in a non-western country and having symptoms were independent risk factors for infection. Of all 1190 travellers 161 (13.5%) had fever, of whom 17 (10.6%) had confirmed influenza. Ten of 17 (59%) sought medical attention abroad. No hospitalisations due to influenza were recorded. Half of travellers with symptomatic infection were considered contagious or incubating while travelling home. All confirmed cases with pre-existing immunity were asymptomatic. Conclusion(s): Influenza is a frequently acquired infectious travel disease. Half of the symptomatic travellers could have imported the infection to the Netherlands. Annually 2 million Dutch travellers visit developing countries, therefore an estimated 13.000 influenza viruses could be imported each year.

N2  - Objective: The 2009 HINI outbreak demonstrated the vulnerability of the health care system to emerge infectious diseases. Emergency departments (ED5) can be especially susceptible to an influx of patients presenting with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs). To better prepare for potential future outbreaks, we hypothesize that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can compensate for missing and inaccurate source data from an emergency department information system (EDIS) to improve ILI surveillance reporting and be more useful in real-time ILI risk prediction compared to the existing surveillance approach of screening by chief presenting complaint. Method(s): A sample of over 20,000 records consisting of 21 Clinical indicators from Oct2009 to Apr2010 was extracted from the EDIS of a midsized Canadian city served by seven EDs. A data cleaning system was developed and applied to overcome missing and incorrect source data typical of EDIS. It identified 3,717 records optimal for AI training and analysis. A novel enhanced feature selection algorithm was created to calculate the contributing score for each Clinical feature to improve Classification of likely ILI diagnosis based on key Clinical indicators. Three AI algorithms (Artifical Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, and C4.5) were then tested to determine accuracy and computing efficiency of ILI Classification. Result(s): C4.5 Decision Tree returned the best results, with the fastest execution time (63 seconds) and Classification accuracy of 89% (specificity of 95.3%). When validated against 476 actual patient charts, the new prediction rule correctly identified 3 1 non-ILI cases more than the previous system. Overall, the system accuracy has been improved by 7.1%. Conclusion(s): Applying Alto the problem of influenza surveillance both improved surveillance accuracy by overcoming uncertainty caused by missing/incorrect data and will enable real-time ILI risk prediction, perhaps resulting in necessary ILI precautions being taken sooner in busy EDs.

N2  - Background: Newborns are susceptible to infections as a consequence of their immunological immaturity. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most frequent pathogen responsible of infant lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). The advantages of breastfeeding in reducing the occurrence of infectious diseases are widely documented but the role of breastfeeding in RSV-related LTRI is controversial. Aim(s): To evaluate whether breastfeeding influence the occurrence of LRTI caused by RSV during the first year of life. Subjects and Methods: These are preliminary data from a multicentre, prospective study that involved 30 Italian neonatology Units. A number of 1814 newborns of >33 weeks of GA were enrolled and followed-up during the first year of age. Conditions occurring during pregnancy potentially influencing the outcomes of the newborn, disturbances (respiratory and non-respiratory) of the newborn after delivery, and environmental risk conditions for RSV infection were recorded. After hospital discharge newborns were followed up until the end of the RSV epidemic season and at completion of the first year of life. Parents/Guardians were interviewed about hospitalisations and breastfeeding. Causes of hospitalisation were ascertained by the enrolling physician. With reference to mother's milk assumption during the first year of life, infants were categorised as never or ever breast fed (BF). The risk of occurrence of RSV-LRTI was evaluated with survival analysis; the relative risks (RR) were calculated considering as reference category the infants ever BF. Result(s): In the entire cohort, on a total of 18,432 person-months of follow-up, we recorded 85 LTRI episodes with proven or suspected RSV infection aetiology. About 7% of the LTRI episodes occurred in infants never BF (415) and 3.9% in infants ever BF. The crude RR for the never BF group was 1.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-2.4) and 1.7 (95% CI 1.1-2.6) when adjusting for negative conditions of pregnancy, presence of disturbances after delivery and negative environmental exposure during the first year of life. The risk increase was independent from the characteristics of breast feeding (exclusive or partial) and also considering as reference category the weaned infants not assuming breast milk. Conclusion(s): According to these preliminary data, breastfeeding might confer protection from RSV induced LRTI in both exclusively or partially breast fed infants and even after weaning. These results are consistent with a positive role of breastfeeding in maturation of newborn immune system.

N2  - Concerns about public health risks of intensive animal production in the Netherlands continue to rise, in particular related to outbreaks of infectious diseases. The aim was to investigate associations between the presence of farm animals around the home address and Q fever and pneumonia. Electronic medical record data for the year 2009 of all patients of 27 general practitioners (GPs) in a region with a high density of animal farms were used. Density of farm animals around the home address was calculated using a Geographic Information System. During the study period, a large Q fever outbreak occurred in this region. Associations between farm exposure variables and pneumonia or 'other infectious disease', the diagnosis code used by GPs for registration of Q fever, were analyzed in 22,406 children (0-17 y) and 70,142 adults (18-70 y), and adjusted for age and sex. In adults, clear exposure-response relationships between the number of goats within 5 km of the home address and pneumonia and 'other infectious disease' were observed. The association with 'other infectious disease' was particularly strong, with an OR [95%CI] of 12.03 [8.79-16.46] for the fourth quartile (>17,190 goats) compared with the first quartile (<2,251 goats). The presence of poultry within 1 km was associated with an increased incidence of pneumonia among adults (OR [95%CI] 1.25 [1.06-1.47]). A high density of goats in a densely populated region was associated with human Q fever. The use of GP records combined with individual exposure estimates using a Geographic Information System is a powerful approach to assess environmental health risks. © 2012 Smit et al.

N2  - Purpose: To motivate children with intellectual disabilities (ID) to learn handwashing and improve their performance by using computer-assisted teaching method. Method(s): A teaching program was implemented using a computerized teaching station with faucet, soap dispenser and towel dispenser as user interface. In response to the children's actions, animations were shown on the computer screen of the teaching station. A controlled study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of the proposed method (study group) with that of the convention teaching method (control group). Both groups of subjects attended a 30-min handwashing lesson twice per week for 2 months. Their performance was evaluated using a handwashing task checklist and a learning motivation questionnaire, and by measuring the completion time and assessing their hand cleanliness. Result(s): The computer-assisted teaching program improved the handwashing performance and learning motivation of the subjects. The study group appeared to outperform the control group. Observations reflected that the subjects were highly motivated to learn handwashing with the computerized teaching station. Conclusion(s): The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the teaching and learning of handwashing skills for children with ID. Implications for Rehabilitation Children with intellectual disabilities are prone to contracting infectious diseases. Proper handwashing can reduce the risk of infection. Handwashing skills are taught in special schools but outbreaks continue to occur. Computer-assisted teaching method has potential to improve the children's learning motivation and handwashing performance. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Outbreaks of pancreas disease (PD) greatly contribute to economic losses due to high mortality, control measures, interrupted production cycles, reduced feed conversion and flesh quality in the aquaculture industries in European salmon-producing countries. The overall objective of this study was to evaluate an effect of potential factors contributing to PD occurrence accounting for spatial congruity of neighboring infected sites, and then create quantitative risk maps for predicting PD occurrence. The study population included active Atlantic salmon farming sites located in the coastal area of 6 southern counties of Norway (where most of PD outbreaks have been reported so far) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Using a Bayesian modeling approach, with and without spatial component, the final model included site latitude, site density, PD history, and local biomass density. Clearly, the PD infected sites were spatially clustered; however, the cluster was well explained by the covariates of the final model. Based on the final model, we produced a map presenting the predicted probability of the PD occurrence in the southern part of Norway. Subsequently, the predictive capacity of the final model was validated by comparing the predicted probabilities with the observed PD outbreaks in 2011. The framework of the study could be applied for spatial studies of other infectious aquatic animal diseases.

T1  - Risk assessment of airborne infectious diseases in aircraft cabins
A1  - Gupta J.K.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Passengers in an aircraft cabin can have different risks of infection from airborne infectious diseases such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and tuberculosis (TB) because of the non-uniform airflow in an aircraft cabin. The current investigation presents a comprehensive approach to assessing the spatial and temporal distributions of airborne infection risk in an aircraft cabin. A case of influenza outbreak was evaluated in a 4-h flight in a twin-aisle, fully occupied aircraft cabin with the index passenger seated at the center of the cabin. The approach considered the characteristics of the exhalation of the droplets carrying infectious agents from the index passenger, the dispersion of these droplets, and the inhalation of the droplets by susceptible passengers. Deterministic and probabilistic approaches were used to quantify the risks based on the amount of inhaled influenza virus RNA particles and quanta, respectively. The probabilistic approach indicated that the number of secondary infection cases can be reduced from 3 to 0 and 20 to 11, for influenza cases if N95 respirator masks are used by the passengers. The approach and methods developed can easily be implemented in other enclosed spaces such as buildings, trains, and buses to assess the infection risk. Practical Implications: Airborne infectious disease transmission could take place in enclosed environments such as buildings and transport vehicles. The infection risk is difficult to estimate, and very few mitigation methods are available. This study used a 4-h flight as an example in analyzing the infection risk from influenza and in mitigating the risk with an N95 mask. The results will be useful to the airline industry in providing necessary protection to passengers and crew, and the results can also be used for other enclosed spaces. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

T1  - Extinction thresholds in deterministic and stochastic epidemic models
A1  - Allen L.J.S.
A1  - Lahodny Jr. G.E. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - The basic reproduction number, R0, one of the most well-known thresholds in deterministic epidemic theory, predicts a disease outbreak if R0>1. In stochastic epidemic theory, there are also thresholds that predict a major outbreak. In the case of a single infectious group, if R0>1 and i infectious individuals are introduced into a susceptible population, then the probability of a major outbreak is approximately 1-(1/R0)i. With multiple infectious groups from which the disease could emerge, this result no longer holds. Stochastic thresholds for multiple groups depend on the number of individuals within each group, ij, j=1,..., n, and on the probability of disease extinction for each group, qj. It follows from multitype branching processes that the probability of a major outbreak is approximately. In this investigation, we summarize some of the deterministic and stochastic threshold theory, illustrate how to calculate the stochastic thresholds, and derive some new relationships between the deterministic and stochastic thresholds. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - The objective of this study was to demonstrate the effects of the nature of the information collected through passive surveillance on the detection of space-time clusters of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 cases reported among dead wild birds in Denmark and Sweden in 2006. Data included 1469 records (109 cases, 1360 controls) collected during the regional epidemic between February and June by passive surveillance of dead wild birds. Laboratory diagnoses were obtained by PCR methods and/or virus isolation. The nature of available information influences both the type of model suitable for analysis and its parameterization. Here, we explored four alternative scan-based methods, suitable for detection of clusters only when case data (univariate permutation model), case and hypothesized epidemiological variables (multivariate permutation model), case and control data (univariate Bernoulli model), and case, control, and hypothesized epidemiological variables (multivariate Bernoulli model) are available. Tufted ducks were particularly common among infected wild bird species detected in Denmark and Sweden during the initial phases of this epidemic, and species group (tufted ducks 62 cases, 57 controls vs. other wild bird species 47 cases, 1303 controls) was considered in the multivariate models as a covariate potentially associated with clustering. Bernoulli and permutation scan analyses both detected multiple significant (P < 0.01) clusters with similar locations, but with certain differences in their numbers and sizes. The observed-to-expected case ratios in the two clusters detected by the multivariate Bernoulli scan model were substantially heterogeneous. However, the permutation model detected only one of the Swedish clusters and only pinpointed the heterogeneity between species on clustering in the same Danish cluster as detected by the Bernoulli model. The output of the methods described here were shown to be highly sensitive to the choice of the probability model for cases and the choice of plausible assumptions to parameterize the scan statistic tests. The results of the multivariate Bernoulli suggest that with noncase information regarding a potential risk factor, such as species of birds, this method is sensitive and efficient in identifying high-risk areas and time periods for regional occurrence of HPAIV and potentially for similar infectious diseases. Results here demonstrate the impact that the nature of the collected information has on the epidemiological investigation of outbreaks. Results show the importance of collecting information on control data and on variables hypothesized to influence disease risk on the identification of periods of time and locations at high risk for the disease and risk factors associated with clustering as part of the national and international surveillance systems.

N2  - Early detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infection in commercial poultry flocks is a critical component of outbreak control. Reducing the time to detect HPAI infection can reduce the risk of disease transmission to other flocks. The timeliness of different types of detection triggers could be dependent on clinical signs that are first observed in a flock, signs that might vary due to HPAI virus strain characteristics. We developed a stochastic disease transmission model to evaluate how transmission characteristics of various HPAI strains might effect the relative importance of increased mortality, drop in egg production, or daily real-time reverse transcriptase (RRT)-PCR testing, toward detecting HPAI infection in a commercial table-egg layer flock. On average, daily RRT-PCR testing resulted in the shortest time to detection (from 3.5 to 6.1 days) depending on the HPAI virus strain and was less variable over a range of transmission parameters compared with other triggers evaluated. Our results indicate that a trigger to detect a drop in egg production would be useful for HPAI virus strains with long infectious periods (6-8 days) and including an egg-drop detection trigger in emergency response plans would lead to earlier and consistent reporting in some cases. We discuss implications for outbreak control and risk of HPAI spread attributed to different HPAI strain characteristics where an increase in mortality or a drop in egg production or both would be among the first clinical signs observed in an infected flock.

N2  - Dengue is the most common arboviral disease of humans, with more than one third of the world's population at risk. Accurate prediction of dengue outbreaks may lead to public health interventions that mitigate the effect of the disease. Predicting infectious disease outbreaks is a challenging task; truly predictive methods are still in their infancy. We describe a novel prediction method utilizing Fuzzy Association Rule Mining to extract relationships between clinical, meteorological, climatic, and socio-political data from Peru. These relationships are in the form of rules. The best set of rules is automatically chosen and forms a classifier. That classifier is then used to predict future dengue incidence as either HIGH (outbreak) or LOW (no outbreak), where these values are defined as being above and below the mean previous dengue incidence plus two standard deviations, respectively. Our automated method built three different fuzzy association rule models. Using the first two weekly models, we predicted dengue incidence three and four weeks in advance, respectively. The third prediction encompassed a four-week period, specifically four to seven weeks from time of prediction. Using previously unused test data for the period 4-7 weeks from time of prediction yielded a positive predictive value of 0.686, a negative predictive value of 0.976, a sensitivity of 0.615, and a specificity of 0.982. We have developed a novel approach for dengue outbreak prediction. The method is general, could be extended for use in any geographical region, and has the potential to be extended to other environmentally influenced infections. The variables used in our method are widely available for most, if not all countries, enhancing the generalizability of our method.

N2  - Roma ethnicity is greatly affected by tuberculosis (TB), AIDS, injecting drugs use (IDU) and imprisonment. We assessed the incidence of several health problems by means of a retrospective cohort study performed in Camp de la Bota, Barcelona (Spain). The 380 individuals included in the 1985 TB outbreak investigation were followed-up until 31 December 2008. One hundred ninety-two subjects (50.5%) were men and 188 (49.5%) women. Information sources included questionnaires taken at the time of this outbreak, a population census and other registries from Barcelona and Catalonia. Cox proportional hazards mixed models were employed in the multivariate survival analysis. By the end of the follow-up, the survival rate was 79.4%; 50 persons (13.1%) had deceased and 28 (7.3%) had emigrated. The incidence of AIDS was 104 cases per 100 000 person-years of follow-up (pyf), IDU was 240 cases pyf, imprisonment was 642 cases pyf and that of TB was 91 cases pyf. Male survival was lower [hazard ratio (HR) 4.22], when the effect of family was taken into account, than when it was not taken into account (HR 3.67). High incidences of AIDS, TB, IDU, imprisonment and poor survival rates have been observed among Roma. Family was found to be an important factor influencing the survival rates: when not considered, the risk of death among men was underestimated.

N2  - When an exotic infectious disease invades a susceptible environment, protection zones are enforced. Historically, such zones have been shaped as circles of equal radius (ER), centred on the location of infected premises. Because the ER policy seems to assume that epidemic dissemination is driven by a similar number of secondary cases generated per primary case, it does not consider whether local features, such as connectivity, influence epidemic dispersal. Here we explored the efficacy of ER protection zones. By generating a geographically explicit scenario that mimicked an actual epidemic, we created protection zones of different geometry, comparing the cost-benefit estimates of ER protection zones to a set of alternatives, which considered a pre-existing connecting network (CN) - the road network. The hypothesis of similar number of cases per ER circle was not substantiated: the number of units at risk per circle differed up to four times among ER circles. Findings also showed that even a small area (of <115km2) revealed network properties. Because the CN policy required 20% less area to be protected than the ER policy, and the CN-based protection zone included a 23.8% greater density of units at risk/km2 than the ER-based alternative, findings supported the view that protection zones are likely to be less costly and more effective if they consider connecting structures, such as road, railroad and/or river networks. The analysis of local geographical factors (contacts, vectors and connectivity) may optimize the efficacy of control measures against epidemics. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

T1  - Escherichia coli O157 infection on cattle farms: The formulation of the force of infection and its effect on control effectiveness
A1  - Zhang X.-S. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - The kernel of modelling transmission dynamics of infectious diseases lies in constructing the force of infection (FOI). Traditionally, it was based on mass-action law. In this paper, we show, based on survey data of Escherichia coli O157 infection on Scottish cattle farms, that the actual form of FOI deviates greatly from mass-action law. Further, control effectiveness deviates qualitatively: the epidemic of mass-action FOI can be controlled with a control effort larger than the so-called herd immunity, while the epidemic inferred from the survey data of E. coli O157 infection was shown to be difficult to control. This indicates that, at least for E. coli O157 infection on cattle farms, it is risky to rely on models of transmission dynamics that were based on mass-action law to design the optimal intervention programme for infectious diseases. This suggests the importance of collecting epidemic data and model selection from data-driven models to infer the most likely model of transmission dynamics. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.

T1  - Women and HIV/AIDS: Stormy beginnings

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Following the transfusion of a young woman with two units of blood infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during a Cesarean section performed at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Unit of Port-Royal Hospital in Paris in 1984, the author realized the danger that this virus would represent for women and their children, at a time when the infection seemed to be confined to homosexuals, drug addicts, hemophiliacs and transfusion recipients. He was confronted with a whole series of issues, including the rejection of HIV-positive women; the need for special precautions in the labor room and operating theater; and the need for these patients to be managed in a single center staffed by skilled and willing healthcare professionals who could help them decide whether or not to continue the pregnancy. The main risks at this time were the onset of life-threatening opportunistic infections during pregnancy and HI V transmission to the child (estimated at 20 % to 30%). Other thorny issues included the case of couples wishing to have children when either of the two members was infected, and the question of professional confidentiality when an immunocompromised HIV-seropositive husband stubbornly refused to inform his wife or to use condoms. It seemed important to bring these women together, especially those of African origin, within a self-help group where they could express themselves openly and discuss their difficulties. Screening for HIV antibodies in early pregnancy became necessary to permit preventive treatment of mother-child HIV transmission, and to inform pediatricians. There was also a need to estimate and monitor the seroprevalence of HIV among pregnant women, and this was done by conducting a " sentinel " survey that was subsequently taken over by INSERM and the European Centre for the Epidemiological Monitoring of AIDS. After listing many other issues that were hotly debated over the years, the author describes how, at the beginning of the epidemic, new proposals intended to systematically improve the lives of these women and their children ran into official procrastination, due to the combined pressure of short-sighted doctors, homosexual groups, and a cohort of sociologists and philosophers posing as apostles of human rights and omnipresent in the media.

T1  - The probability of undetected wild poliovirus circulation after apparent global interruption of transmission

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - The Global Polio Laboratory Network maintains active surveillance for circulating live polioviruses by obtaining and testing stool samples from patients with acute flaccid paralysis. However, most poliovirus infections occur with no symptoms, and questions remain about the probability of undetected wild poliovirus (WPV) circulation after the apparent interruption of WPV transmission in different populations. In the context of making decisions about the timing of oral poliovirus vaccine cessation following global eradication of WPV, policy-makers need an understanding of this probability as a function of time. Prior modeling of the probability of undetected circulation relied on relatively simple models and assumptions, which limits extrapolation to current conditions. In this analysis, the authors revisit the topic and highlight important considerations for policy-makers related to the impact of initial conditions and seasonality and emphasize the need to focus on appropriate characterization of conditions in the last likely reservoirs of the virus. The authors conclude that the probability of undetected WPV circulation may vary significantly for different poliovirus serotypes, places, and conditions, which suggests that achieving the same level of confidence about the true interruption of WPV transmission will require different periods of time for different situations. © 2012 The Auther.

N2  - Introduction: Iran, similar to other countries, had faced H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009. In order to assess its transmission dynamic, we estimated its force of infection (beta) and basic reproductive number (R0). Method(s): Within a middle size primary school in Iran, we actively followed students and detected flu-like syndrome among students and their families in the first three months of academic year; October through December 2009. We estimated the probability of disease transmission within families (beta) fitting random effects Poisson regression model. Moreover, R0 within the school was computed based on the number of detected cases. Result(s): In 452 students, 204 influenza-like syndromes were detected. The estimated beta within families was 0.10; increasing one infectious member within each family was associated with 30% increase in this number. The estimated R0 for the first month was 1.21 (95% C.I.: 0.99, 1.47); corresponding numbers for the first two and first three months were 1.28 (95% C.I.: 1.05, 1.54) and 1.32 (95% C.I.: 1.11, 1.59), respectively. Conclusion(s): It seems that the dynamic transmission of H1N1 virus was more or less comparable with that in other seasonal species. Our findings showed that the virus mainly circulated among students within schools. In addition, it seems that the transmission rate within families was relatively high.

T1  - Leveraging H1N1 infection transmission modeling with proximity sensor microdata

A1  - Stanley K.
A1  - Osgood N. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - The contact networks between individuals can have a profound impact on the evolution of an infectious outbreak within a network. The impact of the interaction between contact network and disease dynamics on infection spread has been investigated using both synthetic and empirically gathered micro-contact data, establishing the utility of micro-contact data for epidemiological insight. However, the infection models tied to empirical contact data were highly stylized and were not calibrated or compared against temporally coincident infection rates, or omitted critical non-network based risk factors such as age or vaccination status. In this paper we present an agent-based simulation model firmly grounded in disease dynamics, incorporating a detailed characterization of the natural history of infection, and 13 weeks worth of micro-contact and participant health and risk factor information gathered during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic. We demonstrate that the micro-contact data-based model yields results consistent with the case counts observed in the study population, derive novel metrics based on the logarithm of the time degree for evaluating individual risk based on contact dynamic properties, and present preliminary findings pertaining to the impact of internal network structures on the spread of disease at an individual level. Through the analysis of detailed output of Monte Carlo ensembles of agent based simulations we were able to recreate many possible scenarios of infection transmission using an empirically grounded dynamic contact network, providing a validated and grounded simulation framework and methodology. We confirmed recent findings on the importance of contact dynamics, and extended the analysis to new measures of the relative risk of different contact dynamics. Because exponentially more time spent with others correlates to a linear increase in infection probability, we conclude that network dynamics have an important, but not dominant impact on infection transmission for H1N1 transmission in our study population.

N2  - Trichinella is an important foodborne pathogen causing considerable morbidity and mortality. To prevent human trichinellosis, meat inspection for Trichinella spp. at slaughter is a key instrument. Current testing is based on minimal infectious dose in humans, but a scientific basis for this approach is lacking. To this end, a dose-response model must be developed, allowing translation of exposure into disease burden at the population level. We developed novel methods for dose-response assessment using outbreak data incorporating sexual reproduction of the parasite. A selection of suitable outbreak studies, reporting numbers exposed and infected, as well as estimated doses, was collated from a literature study. Humans appear to be highly susceptible: exposure to low doses (few larvae) is associated with a considerable risk of infection. As a consequence, levels of Trichinella in meat must be low to maintain acceptable health risks. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background/Aims: Recent studies reveal that acute gastroenteritis can precipitate irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms leading to the concept of post-infectious IBS. However, the overall contribution of gastroenteritis to the total IBS prevalence is unknown. In this exercise we try to estimate the contribution of gastroenteritis in IBS using the published literature and a longitudinal approach. Method(s): Existing literature was reviewed to determine the incidence of IBS after gastroenteritis, the rate of remission over time, data on rates of gastroenteritis in a given population and any patterns of resistance to these effects in human populations. This produced 3 models. The first assumed all humans were susceptible to gastroenteritis and its ability to produce IBS. The second assumed (using meta-analysis data) that 90% of humans in a given outbreak would be resistant to this effect. The third model used a high gastroenteritis exposure rate as might be seen in military deployment. Result(s): In model 1, the prevalence was unrealistically high with an eventual steady state of 43.6% of the population affected by IBS. In a very conservative approach (model 2), steady state was achieved after 10 years to an overall prevalence of 8.9%. Interestingly, based on a high 1 year exposure rate such as military deployment, the maximum prevalence (steady state) was reached before 1 year suggesting high risk. Conclusion(s): Although hypothetical in approach, based on conservative estimates in existing literature the contribution of gastroenteritis to the overall prevalence of IBS is substantial. © 2012 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Modelling studies on the spatial distribution and spread of infectious diseases are becoming increasingly detailed and sophisticated, with global risk mapping and epidemic modelling studies now popular. Yet, in deriving populations at risk of disease estimates, these spatial models must rely on existing global and regional datasets on population distribution, which are often based on outdated and coarse resolution data. Moreover, a variety of different methods have been used to model population distribution at large spatial scales. In this review we describe the main global gridded population datasets that are freely available for health researchers and compare their construction methods, and highlight the uncertainties inherent in these population datasets. We review their application in past studies on disease risk and dynamics, and discuss how the choice of dataset can affect results. Moreover, we highlight how the lack of contemporary, detailed and reliable data on human population distribution in low income countries is proving a barrier to obtaining accurate large-scale estimates of population at risk and constructing reliable models of disease spread, and suggest research directions required to further reduce these barriers. © 2012 Linard and Tatem; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Since community structures in real networks play a major role for the epidemic spread, we therefore explore two interacting diseases spreading in networks with community structures. As a network model with community structures, we propose a random clique network model composed of different orders of cliques. We further assume that each disease spreads only through one type of cliques; this assumption corresponds to the issue that two diseases spread inside communities and outside them. Considering the relationship between the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and the bond percolation theory, we apply this theory to clique random networks under the assumption that the occupation probability is clique-type dependent, which is consistent with the observation that infection rates inside a community and outside it are different, and obtain a number of statistical properties for this model. Two interacting diseases that compete the same hosts are also investigated, which leads to a natural generalization of analyzing an arbitrary number of infectious diseases. For two-disease dynamics, the clustering effect is hypersensitive to the cohesiveness and concentration of cliques; this illustrates the impacts of clustering and the composition of subgraphs in networks on epidemic behavior. The analysis of coexistence/bistability regions provides significant insight into the relationship between the network structure and the potential epidemic prevalence. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The science and management of infectious disease are entering a new stage. Increasingly public policy to manage epidemics focuses on motivating people, through social distancing policies, to alter their behavior to reduce contacts and reduce public disease risk. Person-to-person contacts drive human disease dynamics. People value such contacts and are willing to accept some disease risk to gain contact-related benefits. The cost-benefit trade-offs that shape contact behavior, and hence the course of epidemics, are often only implicitly incorporated in epidemiologicalmodels. This approach creates difficulty in parsing out the effects of adaptive behavior. We use an epidemiological-economic model of disease dynamics to explicitly model the trade-offs that drive person-toperson contact decisions. Results indicate that including adaptive human behavior significantly changes the predicted course of epidemics and that this inclusion has implications for parameter estimation and interpretation and for the development of social distancing policies. Acknowledging adaptive behavior requires a shift in thinking about epidemiological processes and parameters.

T1  - Modelling the performance of isoniazid preventive therapy for reducing tuberculosis in HIV endemic settings: The effects of network structure
A1  - Mills H.L.
A1  - Cohen T.
A1  - Colijn C. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Individuals living with HIV experience a much higher risk of progression from latent M. tuberculosis infection to active tuberculosis (TB) disease relative to individuals with intact immune systems. A several-month daily course of a single drug during latent infection (i.e. isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT)) has proved in clinical trials to substantially reduce an HIV-infected individual's risk of TB disease. As a result of these findings and ongoing studies, the World Health Organization has produced strong guidelines for implementing IPT on a community-wide scale for individuals with HIV at risk of TB disease. To date, there has been limited use of IPT at a community-wide level. In this paper, we present a new co-network model for HIV and TB co-epidemics to address questions about how the population-level impact of community-wide IPT may differ from the individual-level impact of IPT offered to selected individuals. In particular, we examine how the effect of clustering of contacts within high-TB incidence communities may affect the rates of re-infection with TB and how this clustering modifies the expected population-level effects of IPT. We find that populations with clustering of respiratory contacts experience aggregation of TB cases and high numbers of re-infection events. While, encouragingly, the overall population-level effects of community-wide IPT appear to be sustained regardless of network structure, we find that in populations where these contacts are highly clustered, there is dramatic heterogeneity in the impact of IPT: in some sub-regions of these populations, TB is nearly eliminated, while in others, repeated re-infection almost completely undermines the effect of IPT. Our findings imply that as IPT programmes are brought to scale, we should expect local heterogeneity of effectiveness as a result of the complex patterns of disease transmission within communities. © 2011 The Royal Society.

T1  - A stochastic SIS epidemic with demography: Initial stages and time to extinction
A1  - Andersson P.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - We study an open population stochastic epidemic model from the time of introduction of the disease, through a possible outbreak and to extinction. The model describes an SIS (susceptible-infective-susceptible) epidemic where all individuals, including infectious ones, reproduce at a given rate. An approximate expression for the outbreak probability is derived using a coupling argument. Further, we analyse the behaviour of the model close to quasi-stationarity, and the time to disease extinction, with the aid of a diffusion approximation. In this situation the number of susceptibles and infectives behaves as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, centred around the stationary point, for an exponentially distributed time before going extinct. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Based on epidemiological data, it is believed that human-to-human transmission plays an important role in Nipah virus outbreaks. No experimental data are currently available on the potential routes of human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus. In a first dose-finding experiment in Syrian hamsters, it was shown that Nipah virus was predominantly shed via the respiratory tract within nasal and oropharyngeal secretions. Although Nipah viral RNA was detected in urogenital and rectal swabs, no infectious virus was recovered from these samples, suggesting no viable virus was shed via these routes. In addition, hamsters inoculated with high doses shed significantly higher amounts of viable Nipah virus particles in comparison with hamsters infected with lower inoculum doses. Using the highest inoculum dose, three potential routes of Nipah virus transmission were investigated in the hamster model: transmission via fomites, transmission via direct contact and transmission via aerosols. It was demonstrated that Nipah virus is transmitted efficiently via direct contact and inefficiently via fomites, but not via aerosols. These findings are in line with epidemiological data which suggest that direct contact with nasal and oropharyngeal secretions of Nipah virus infected individuals resulted in greater risk of Nipah virus infection. The data provide new and much-needed insights into the modes and efficiency of Nipah virus transmission and have important public health implications with regards to the risk assessment and management of future Nipah virus outbreaks.

T1  - How to make predictions about future infectious disease risks
A1  - Woolhouse M. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Formal, quantitative approaches are now widely used to make predictions about the likelihood of an infectious disease outbreak, how the disease will spread, and how to control it. Several wellestablished methodologies are available, including risk factor analysis, risk modelling and dynamic modelling. Even so, predictive modelling is very much the 'art of the possible', which tends to drive research effort towards some areas and away from others which may be at least as important. Building on the undoubted success of quantitative modelling of the epidemiology and control of human and animal diseases such as AIDS, influenza, foot-and-mouth disease and BSE, attention needs to be paid to developing a more holistic framework that captures the role of the underlying drivers of disease risks, from demography and behaviour to land use and climate change. At the same time, there is still considerable room for improvement in how quantitative analyses and their outputs are communicated to policy makers and other stakeholders. A starting point would be generally accepted guidelines for 'good practice' for the development and the use of predictive models. © 2011 The Royal Society.

N2  - St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV, Flavivirus, Flaviviridae) is an emerging mosquito-borne pathogen in South America, with human SLEV encephalitis cases reported in Argentina and Brazil. Genotype III strains of SLEV were isolated from Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes in Cordoba, Argentina in 2005, during the largest SLEV outbreak ever reported in South America. The present study tested the hypothesis that the recent, epidemic SLEV strain exhibits greater virulence in birds as compared with a non-epidemic genotype III strain isolated from mosquitoes in Santa Fe Province 27 years earlier. The observed differences in infection parameters between adult House sparrows (Passer domesticus) that were needle-inoculated with either the epidemic or historic SLEV strain were not statistically significant. However, only the House sparrows that were infected with the epidemic strain achieved infectious-level viremia titers sufficient to infect Cx. spp. mosquitoes vectors. Furthermore, the vertebrate reservoir competence index values indicated an approximately 3-fold increase in amplification potential of House sparrows infected with the epidemic strain when pre-existing flavivirus-reactive antibodies were present, suggesting the possibility that antibody-dependent enhancement may increase the risk of avian-amplified transmission of SLEV in South America. © 2011 Diaz et al.

N2  - The identification of patients who pose an epidemic hazard when they are admitted to a health facility plays a role in preventing the risk of hospital acquired infection. An automated clinical decision support system to detect suspected cases, based on the principle of syndromic surveillance, is being developed at the University of Lyon's Hopital de la Croix-Rousse. This tool will analyse structured data and narrative reports from computerized emergency department (ED) medical records. The first step consists of developing an application (UrgIndex) which automatically extracts and encodes information found in narrative reports. The purpose of the present article is to describe and evaluate this natural language processing system. Narrative reports have to be pre-processed before utilizing the French-language medical multi-terminology indexer (ECMT) for standardized encoding. UrgIndex identifies and excludes syntagmas containing a negation and replaces non-standard terms (abbreviations, acronyms, spelling errors...). Then, the phrases are sent to the ECMT through an Internet connection. The indexer's reply, based on Extensible Markup Language, returns codes and literals corresponding to the concepts found in phrases. UrgIndex filters codes corresponding to suspected infections. Recall is defined as the number of relevant processed medical concepts divided by the number of concepts evaluated (coded manually by the medical epidemiologist). Precision is defined as the number of relevant processed concepts divided by the number of concepts proposed by UrgIndex. Recall and precision were assessed for respiratory and cutaneous syndromes. Evaluation of 1,674 processed medical concepts contained in 100 ED medical records (50 for respiratory syndromes and 50 for cutaneous syndromes) showed an overall recall of 85.8% (95% CI: 84.1-87.3). Recall varied from 84.5% for respiratory syndromes to 87.0% for cutaneous syndromes. The most frequent cause of lack of processing was non-recognition of the term by UrgIndex (9.7%). Overall precision was 79.1% (95% CI: 77.3-80.8). It varied from 81.4% for respiratory syndromes to 77.0% for cutaneous syndromes. This study demonstrates the feasibility of and interest in developing an automated method for extracting and encoding medical concepts from ED narrative reports, the first step required for the detection of potentially infectious patients at epidemic risk.

N2  - Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses of H5 and H7 subtypes have the potential to mutate into highly pathogenic strains (HPAI), which can threaten human health and cause huge economic losses. The current knowledge on the mechanisms of mutation from LPAI to HPAI is insufficient for predicting which H5 or H7 strains will mutate into an HPAI strain, and since the molecular changes necessary for the change in virulence seemingly occur at random, the probability of mutation depends on the number of virus replicates, which is associated with the number of birds that acquire infection. We estimated the transmission dynamics of LPAI viruses in turkeys using serosurveillance data from past epidemics in Italy. We fitted the proportions of birds infected in 36 flocks into a hierarchical model to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) and possible variations in R0 among flocks caused by differences among farms. We also estimated the distributions of the latent and infectious periods, using experimental infection data with outbreak strains. These were then combined with the R0 to simulate LPAI outbreaks and characterise the resulting dynamics. The estimated mean within-flock R0 in the population of infected flocks was 5.5, indicating that an infectious bird would infect an average of more than five susceptible birds. The results also indicate that the presence of seropositive birds does not necessarily mean that the virus has already been cleared and the flock is no longer infective, so that seropositive flocks may still constitute a risk of infection for other flocks. In light of these results, the enforcement of appropriate restrictions, the culling of seropositive flocks, or pre-emptive slaughtering may be useful. The model and parameter estimates presented in this paper provide the first complete picture of LPAI dynamics in turkey flocks and could be used for designing a suitable surveillance program. © 2011 Comin et al.

N2  - Listeria monocytogenes contains (i) epidemic clone (EC) strains, which have been linked to the majority of listeriosis outbreaks worldwide and are overrepresented among sporadic cases in the United States, and (ii) strains commonly isolated from ready-to-eat foods that carry a mutation leading to a premature stop codon (PMSC) in inlA, which encodes the key virulence factor internalin A (InlA). Internalin A binds certain isoforms of the cellular receptor E-cadherin to facilitate crossing the intestinal barrier during the initial stages of an L. monocytogenes infection. Juvenile guinea pigs, which express the human isoform of E-cadherin that binds InlA, were intragastrically challenged with a range of doses of (i) an EC strain associated with a listeriosis outbreak or (ii) a strain carrying a PMSC mutation in inlA. Recovery of L. monocytogenes from tissues (i.e., liver, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and ileum) was used to develop strain-specific dose-response curves on the basis of individual and combined organ data. Modeling of individual and combined organ data revealed an approximate 1.2 to 1.3 log10 increase in the median infectious dose for the strain carrying a PMSC in inlA relative to that for the EC strain. Inclusion of the strain parameter significantly improved the goodness of fit for individual and combined organ models, indicating a significant shift in median infectious dose for guinea pigs challenged with an inlA PMSC strain compared to that for guinea pigs challenged with an EC strain. Results from this work provide evidence that the L. monocytogenes dose-response relationship is strain specific and will provide critical data for enhancement of current risk assessments and development of future risk assessments. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

T1  - Use of Risk Assessment and Likelihood Estimation to Analyze Spatial Distribution Pattern of Respiratory Infection Cases
A1  - Sze-To G.N.
A1  - Chao C.Y.H. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Obvious spatial infection patterns are often observed in cases associated with airborne transmissible diseases. Existing quantitative infection risk assessment models analyze the observed cases by assuming a homogeneous infectious particle concentration and ignore the spatial infection pattern, which may cause errors. This study aims at developing an approach to analyze spatial infection patterns associated with infectious respiratory diseases or other airborne transmissible diseases using infection risk assessment and likelihood estimation. Mathematical likelihood, based on binomial probability, was used to formulate the retrospective component with some additional mathematical treatments. Together with an infection risk assessment model that can address spatial heterogeneity, the method can be used to analyze the spatial infection pattern and retrospectively estimate the influencing parameters causing the cases, such as the infectious source strength of the pathogen. AVaricellaoutbreak was selected to demonstrate the use of the new approach. The infectious source strength estimated by the Wells-Riley concept using the likelihood estimation was compared with the estimation using the existing method. It was found that the maximum likelihood estimation matches the epidemiological observation of the outbreak case much better than the estimation under the assumption of homogeneous infectious particle concentration. Influencing parameters retrospectively estimated using the new approach can be used as input parameters in quantitative infection risk assessment of the disease under other scenarios. The approach developed in this study can also serve as an epidemiological tool in outbreak investigation. Limitations and further developments are also discussed. © 2010 Society for Risk Analysis.

T1  - Palivizumab for immunoprophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis in high-risk infants and young children: A systematic review and additional economic modelling of subgroup analyses
A1  - Wang D.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a seasonal infectious disease, with epidemics occurring annually from October to March in the UK. It is a very common infection in infants and young children and can lead to hospitalisation, particularly in those who are premature or who have chronic lung disease (CLD) or congenital heart disease (CHD). Palivizumab (Synagis, MedImmune) is a monoclonal antibody designed to provide passive immunity against RSV and thereby prevent or reduce the severity of RSV infection. It is licensed for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract infection caused by RSV in children at high risk. While it is recognised that a policy of using palivizumab for all children who meet the licensed indication does not meet conventional UK standards of costeffectiveness, most clinicians feel that its use is justified in some children. Objective(s): To use systematic review evidence to estimate the cost-effectiveness of immunoprophylaxis of RSV using palivizumab in different subgroups of children with or without CLD or CHD who are at high risk of serious morbidity from RSV infection. Data sources: A systematic review of the literature and an economic evalutaion was carried out. The bibliographic databases included the Cochrane Library [Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and Health Technology Assessment (HTA)] and five other databases, from inception to 2009. Research registries of ongoing trials including Current Controlled Trials metaRegister, Clinical Trials.gov and the National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research Network Portfolio were also searched. Review methods: Searches were conducted for prognostic and hospitalisation studies covering 1950-2009 (the original report searches conducted in 2007 covering the period 1950-2007 were rerun in August 2009 to cover the period 2007-9) and the database of all references from the original report was sifted to find any relevant studies that may have been missed. The risk factors identified from the systematic review of included studies were analysed and synthesised using stata. The base-case decision tree model developed in the original HTA journal publication [Health Technol Assess 2008;12(36)] was used to derive the cost-effectiveness of immunoprophylaxis of RSV using palivizumab in different subgroups of pre-term infants and young children who are at high risk of serious morbidity from RSV infection. Cost-effective spectra of prophylaxis with palivizumab compared with no prophylaxis for children without CLD/CHD, children with CLD, children with acyanotic CHD and children with cyanotic CHD were derived. Result(s): Thirteen studies were included in this analysis. Analysis of 16,128 subgroups showed that prophylaxis with palivizumab may be cost-effective [at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 30,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)] for some subgroups. For example, for children without CLD or CHD, the cost-effective subgroups included children under 6 weeks old at the start of the RSV season who had at least two other risk factors that were considered in this report and were born at 24 weeks gestational age (GA) or less, but did not include children who were > 9 months old at the start of the RSV season or had a GA of > 32 weeks. For children with CLD, the cost-effective subgroups included children < 6 months old at the start of the RSV season who were born at 28 weeks GA or less, but did not include children who were > 21 months old at the start of the RSV season. For children with acyanotic CHD, the cost-effective subgroups included children < 6 months old at the start of the RSV season who were born at 24 weeks GA or less, but did not include children who were > 21 months old at the start of the RSV season. For children with cyanotic CHD, the cost-effective subgroups included children < 6 weeks old at the start of the RSV season who were born at 24 weeks GA or less, but did not include children who were > 12 months old at the start of the RSV season. Limitation(s): The poor quality of the studies feeding numerical results into this analysis means that the true cost-effectiveness may vary considerably from that estimated here. There is a risk that the relatively high mathematical precision of the point estimates of costeffectiveness may be quite inaccurate because of poor-quality inputs. Conclusion(s): Prophylaxis with palivizumab does not represent good value for money based on the current UK incremental cost-effectiveness ratio threshold of 30,000/QALY when used unselectively in children without CLD/CHD or children with CLD or CHD. This subgroup analysis showed that prophylaxis with palivizumab may be cost-effective (at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 30,000/QALY) for some subgroups. In summary, the costeffective subgroups for children who had no CLD or CHD must contain at least two other risk factors apart from GA and birth age. The cost-effective subgroups for children who had CLD or CHD do not necessarily need to have any other risk factors. Future research should be directed towards conducting much larger, better powered and better reported studies to derive better estimates of the risk factor effect sizes.

N2  - During community epidemics, infections may be imported within hospital and transmitted to hospitalized patients. Hospital outbreaks of communicable diseases have been increasingly reported during the last decades and have had significant consequences in terms of patient morbidity, mortality, and associated costs. Quantitative studies are thus needed to estimate the risks of communicable diseases among hospital patients, taking into account the epidemiological process outside, hospital and host-related risk factors of infection and the role of other patients and healthcare workers as sources of infection. We propose a multiplicative hazard regression model to analyze the risk of acquiring a communicable disease by patients at hospital. This model derives from epidemiological data on communicable disease epidemics in the community, hospital ward, patient susceptibility to infection, and exposure of patients to infection at hospital. The model estimates the relative effect of each of these factors on a patient's risk of communicable disease. Using individual data on patients and health care workers in a teaching hospital during the 2004-2005 influenza season in Lyon (France), we show the ability of the model to assess the risk of influenza-like illness among hospitalized patients. The significant effects on the risk of influenza-like illness were those of old age, exposure to infectious patients or health care workers, and a stay in a medical care unit. The proposed multiplicative hazard regression model could be an interesting epidemiological tool to quantify the risk of communicable disease at hospital during community epidemics and the uncertainty inherent in such quantification. Furthermore, key epidemiological, environmental, host, or exposure factors that influence this risk can be identified.

N2  - There is an urgent need to understand how the provision of information influences individual risk perception and how this in turn shapes the evolution of epidemics. Individuals are influenced by information in complex and unpredictable ways. Emerging infectious diseases, such as the recent swine flu epidemic, may be particular hotspots for a media-fueled rush to vaccination; conversely, seasonal diseases may receive little media attention, despite their high mortality rate, due to their perceived lack of newness. METHODS : We formulate a deterministic transmission and vaccination model to investigate the effects of media coverage on the transmission dynamics of influenza. The population is subdivided into different classes according to their disease status. The compartmental model includes the effect of media coverage on reporting the number of infections as well as the number of individuals successfully vaccinated. A threshold parameter (the basic reproductive ratio) is analytically derived and used to discuss the local stability of the disease-free steady state. The impact of costs that can be incurred, which include vaccination, education, implementation and campaigns on media coverage, are also investigated using optimal control theory. A simplified version of the model with pulse vaccination shows that the media can trigger a vaccinating panic if the vaccine is imperfect and simplified messages result in the vaccinated mixing with the infectives without regard to disease risk. The effects of media on an outbreak are complex. Simplified understandings of disease epidemiology, propogated through media soundbites, may make the disease significantly worse.

N2  - It is estimated that one third of the world's population is latently infected with tuberculosis (TB). The HIV epidemic fuels the TB epidemic by increasing the risk of reactivation of latent TB infection and by facilitating a more rapid progression of TB disease. Although the incidence of TB is constant or decreasing in many regions of the world, rates remain high in developing countries as a consequence of the HIV epidemic. This study was conducted as a collaboration of the Infectious Diseases department of Imam Khomeini Hospital with the Microbiology department of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The hospital dataset of 94 patients admitted with TB during 2003-2005 was reviewed. We aimed to study factors correlating with positive blood culture including age, sex, immune deficiency status, HIV serology and SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) status. In this study, we found that positive blood cultures are more frequent in patients less than 45 years old. Positive blood cultures were also more frequent in HIV infected patients and there was a significant correlation between blood culture and SIRS status. Therefore, we recommend that we obtain blood cultures from these high-risk groups in order to increase early detection of TB.

T1  - Disrupting seasonality to control disease outbreaks: The case of koi herpes virus
A1  - Omori R.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Common carp accounts for a substantial proportion of global freshwater aquaculture production. Koi herpes virus (KHV), a highly virulent disease affecting carp that emerged in the late 1990s, is a serious threat to this industry. After a fish is infected with KHV, there is a temperature dependent delay before it becomes infectious, and a further delay before mortality. Consequently, KHV epidemiology is driven by seasonal changes in water temperature. Also, it has been proposed that outbreaks could be controlled by responsive management of water temperature in aquaculture setups. We use a mathematical model to analyse the effect of seasonal temperature cycles on KHV epidemiology, and the impact of attempting to control outbreaks by disrupting this cycle. We show that, although disease progression is fast in summer and slow in winter, total mortality over a 2-year period is similar for outbreaks that start in either season. However, for outbreaks that start in late autumn, mortality may be low and immunity high. A single bout of water temperature management can be an effective outbreak control strategy if it is started as soon as dead fish are detected and maintained for a long time. It can also be effective if the frequency of infectious fish is used as an indicator for the beginning of treatment. In this case, however, there is a risk that starting the treatment too soon will increase mortality relative to the case when no treatment is used. This counterproductive effect can be avoided if multiple bouts of temperature management are used. We conclude that disrupting normal seasonal patterns in water temperature can be an effective strategy for controlling koi herpes virus. Exploiting the seasonal patterns, possibly in combination with temperature management, can also induce widespread immunity to KHV in a cohort of fish. However, employing these methods successfully requires careful assessment to ensure that the treatment is started, and finished, at the correct time. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Several routes contribute to the spread of classical swine fever (CSF) during outbreaks of this disease. However, for many infected herds in recent epidemics, no route of virus introduction could be indentified. To obtain more insight into the relative importance of secretions and excretions in transmission of CSF virus, a model was developed. This model quantified the daily transmission probabilities from one infectious pig to one susceptible pig, using quantitative data on: (a) virus excretion by infected pigs, (b) survival of virus in the environment and (c) virus dose needed to infect susceptible pigs. Furthermore, the model predicted the relative contribution of secretions and excretions to this daily probability of infection of a susceptible pig. Three virus strains that differed in virulence were evaluated with the model: the highly virulent strain Brescia, the moderately virulent strain Paderborn and the low virulent strain Zoelen. Results suggest that it is highly probable that susceptible pigs in contact with Brescia or Paderborn infected pigs will be infected. For a pig in contact with a Zoelen infected pig, infection is less likely. When contact with blood is excluded, the predicted overall probability of infection was only 0.08 over the entire infectious period. The three strains differed in the relative contribution of secretions and excretions to transmission, although blood had a high probability of causing infection of a susceptible pig when in contact with a pig infected with any strain. This supports the statement that during outbreaks, control measures should ideally be based on the characteristics of the specific virus strain involved, which implies the development of strain-specific measures. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Since 1997, when the goal of interrupting measles transmission by 2010 was adopted, substantial progress has been made toward the elimination of measles in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). For the 22 EMR member countries, routine coverage with the first dose of a measles-containing vaccine (MCV) increased from 70% in 1997 to 82% in 2009. All 22 countries conducted measles catch-up vaccination campaigns during 1994-2009, and most conducted follow-up campaigns as needed. Of the 22 EMR countries, 19 have established case-based surveillance for measles with laboratory confirmation. Reported measles cases decreased by 86% during 1998-2008, and estimated measles mortality decreased by 93% during 2000-2008, accounting for 17% of global measles mortality reduction during that period. Despite these successes, several significant challenges remain, and the EMR will not be able to achieve measles elimination by the end of 2010. Achieving and maintaining high population immunity with 2 doses of MCV, improving sensitive case-based surveillance, identifying and vaccinating high-risk subpopulation groups, and appropriately responding to outbreaks are key steps needed to achieve the goal. © The Author 2011.

N2  - The effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination programs depends on individual-level compliance. Perceptions about risks associated with infection and vaccination can strongly influence vaccination decisions and thus the ultimate course of an epidemic. Here we investigate the interplay between contact patterns, influenza-related behavior, and disease dynamics by incorporating game theory into network models. When individuals make decisions based on past epidemics, we find that individuals with many contacts vaccinate, whereas individuals with few contacts do not. However, the threshold number of contacts above which to vaccinate is highly dependent on the overall network structure of the population and has the potential to oscillate more wildly than has been observed empirically. When we increase the number of prior seasons that individuals recall when making vaccination decisions, behavior and thus disease dynamics become less variable. For some networks, we also find that higher flu transmission rates may, counterintuitively, lead to lower (vaccine-mediated) disease prevalence. Our work demonstrates that rich and complex dynamics can result from the interaction between infectious diseases, human contact patterns, and behavior. © 2011 Cornforth et al.

T1  - Community structure in social networks: Applications for epidemiological modelling
A1  - Kitchovitch S.
A1  - Lio P. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - During an infectious disease outbreak people will often change their behaviour to reduce their risk of infection. Furthermore, in a given population, the level of perceived risk of infection will vary greatly amongst individuals. The difference in perception could be due to a variety of factors including varying levels of information regarding the pathogen, quality of local healthcare, availability of preventative measures, etc. In this work we argue that we can split a social network, representing a population, into interacting communities with varying levels of awareness of the disease. We construct a theoretical population and study which such communities suffer most of the burden of the disease and how their awareness affects the spread of infection. We aim to gain a better understanding of the effects that community-structured networks and variations in awareness, or risk perception, have on the disease dynamics and to promote more community-resolved modelling in epidemiology. © 2011 Kitchovitch, Lio.

N2  - Objectives: We present the results of a 2005 case-control study of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) breakdowns in English and Welsh herds. The herd management, farming practices, and environmental factors of 401 matched pairs of case and control herds were investigated to provide a picture of herd-level risk factors in areas of varying bTB incidence. Method(s): A global conditional logistic regression model, with region-specific variants, was used to compare case herds that had experienced a confirmed bTB breakdown to contemporaneous control herds matched on region, herd type, herd size, and parish testing interval. Result(s): Contacts with cattle from contiguous herds and sourcing cattle from herds with a recent history of bTB were associated with an increased risk in both the global and regional analyses. Operating a farm over several premises, providing cattle feed inside the housing, and the presence of badgers were also identified as significantly associated with an increased bTB risk. Conclusion(s): Steps taken to minimize cattle contacts with neighboring herds and altering trading practices could have the potential to reduce the size of the bTB epidemic. In principle, limiting the interactions between cattle and wildlife may also be useful; however this study did not highlight any specific measures to implement. © 2011 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

T1  - Using a neural network for mining interpretable relationships of West Nile risk factors
A1  - Ghosh D.
A1  - Guha R. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - The West Nile Virus (WNV) is an infectious disease spreading rapidly throughout the United States, causing illness among thousands of birds, animals, and humans. Yet, we only have a rudimentary understanding of how the mosquito-borne virus operates in complex avian-human environmental systems. The four broad categories of risk factors underlying WNV incidences are: environmental (temperature, precipitation, wetlands), socioeconomic (housing age), built-environment (catch basins, ditches), and existing mosquito abatement policies.This research first built a model incorporating the non-linear relationship between WNV incidences and hypothesized risk factors and second, identified important factor(s) whose management would result in effective disease prevention and containment. The research was conducted in the Metropolitan area of Minnesota, which had experienced significant WNV outbreaks from 2002.Computational neural network (CNN) modeling was used to understand the occurrence of WNV infected dead birds because of their ability to capture complex relationships with higher accuracy than linear models. Further a detailed interpretation technique, based on weights and biases of the network, provided a means for extracting relationships between risk factors and disease occurrence.Five risk factors: proximity to bogs, lakes, temperature, housing age, and developed medium density land cover class, were selected by the model. The detailed interpretation indicated that temperature, age of houses, and developed medium density land cover were positively related, and distance to bogs and lakes were negatively related to the incidence of WNV.This paper provides both applied and methodological contributions to the field of health geography. The relationships between the risk factors and disease occurrence could contribute to vector control strategies such as targeted insecticide spraying near bogs and lakes, mosquito control treatments for older houses, and extensive mapping, inspection, and treatments of catch basins. The proposed interpretation technique expanded the role of CNN models in health sciences as both predictive and explanatory tools. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - A prospective survey of social mixing patterns relevant to respiratory disease transmission by large droplets (e.g., influenza) or small droplet nuclei (e.g., tuberculosis) was performed in a South African township in 2010. A total of 571 randomly selected participants recorded the numbers, times, and locations of close contacts (physical/nonphysical) and indoor casual contacts met daily. The median number of physical contacts was 12 (interquartile range (IQR), 7-18), the median number of close contacts was 20 (IQR, 13-29), and the total number of indoor contacts was 30 (IQR, 12-54). Physical and close contacts were most frequent and age-associative in youths aged 5-19 years. Numbers of close contacts were 40% higher than in corresponding populations in industrialized countries (P < 0.001). This may put township communities at higher risk for epidemics of acute respiratory illnesses. Simulations of an acute influenza epidemic predominantly involved adolescents and young adults, indicating that control strategies should be directed toward these age groups. Of all contacts, 86.2% occurred indoors with potential exposure to respiratory droplet nuclei, of which 27.2%, 20.1%, 20.0%, and 8.0% were in transport, own household, creche/school, and work locations, respectively. Indoor contact time was long in households and short during transport. High numbers of indoor contacts and intergenerational mixing in households and transport may contribute to exceptionally high rates of tuberculosis transmission reported in the community. © The Author 2011.

N2  - Epidemiological studies have shown that imposing travel restrictions to prevent or delay an influenza pandemic may not be feasible. To delay an epidemic substantially, an extremely high proportion of trips (~99%) would have to be restricted in a homogeneously mixing population. Influenza is, however, strongly influenced by age-dependent transmission dynamics, and the effectiveness of age-specific travel restrictions, such as the selective restriction of travel by children, has yet to be examined. A simple stochastic model was developed to describe the importation of infectious cases into a population and to model local chains of transmission seeded by imported cases. The probability of a local epidemic, and the time period until a major epidemic takes off, were used as outcome measures, and travel restriction policies in which children or adults were preferentially restricted were compared to age-blind restriction policies using an age-dependent next generation matrix parameterized for influenza H1N1-2009. Restricting children from travelling would yield greater reductions to the short-term risk of the epidemic being established locally than other policy options considered, and potentially could delay an epidemic for a few weeks. However, given a scenario with a total of 500 imported cases over a period of a few months, a substantial reduction in the probability of an epidemic in this time period is possible only if the transmission potential were low and assortativity (i.e. the proportion of contacts within-group) were unrealistically high. In all other scenarios considered, age-structured travel restrictions would not prevent an epidemic and would not delay the epidemic for longer than a few weeks. Selectively restricting children from traveling overseas during a pandemic may potentially delay its arrival for a few weeks, depending on the characteristics of the pandemic strain, but could have less of an impact on the economy compared to restricting adult travelers. However, as long as adults have at least a moderate potential to trigger an epidemic, selectively restricting the higher risk group (children) may not be a practical option to delay the arrival of an epidemic substantially.

T1  - Unintended consequences of conservation actions: Managing disease in complex ecosystems

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Infectious diseases are increasingly recognised to be a major threat to biodiversity. Disease management tools such as control of animal movements and vaccination can be used to mitigate the impact and spread of diseases in targeted species. They can reduce the risk of epidemics and in turn the risks of population decline and extinction. However, all species are embedded in communities and interactions between species can be complex, hence increasing the chance of survival of one species can have repercussions on the whole community structure. In this study, we use an example from the Serengeti ecosystem in Tanzania to explore how a vaccination campaign against Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) targeted at conserving the African lion (Panthera leo), could affect the viability of a coexisting threatened species, the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus). Assuming that CDV plays a role in lion regulation, our results suggest that a vaccination programme, if successful, risks destabilising the simple two-species system considered, as simulations show that vaccination interventions could almost double the probability of extinction of an isolated cheetah population over the next 60 years. This work uses a simple example to illustrate how predictive modelling can be a useful tool in examining the consequence of vaccination interventions on non-target species. It also highlights the importance of carefully considering linkages between human-intervention, species viability and community structure when planning species-based conservation actions. © 2011 Chauvenet et al.

N2  - The risk of individuals becoming infected during an epidemic of infectious disease can vary as the disease progresses. Monitoring this risk may provide information about the dynamics of transmission. This study describes the epidemic curve for an epidemic of equine influenza (EI) in a closed population of horses predominantly immunologically naive to EI at a 3-day event at Morgan Park in southern Queensland, Australia. The hazard function suggested that a subset of horses were at reduced risk of becoming infected. This highlights the importance, when modelling infectious disease in populations, of considering possible differences in the risk of infection among subgroups in the population. © 2011 NSW Industry & Investment.

N2  - There is concern among public health professionals that the current economic downturn, initiated by the financial crisis that started in 2007, could precipitate the transmission of infectious diseases while also limiting capacity for control. Although studies have reviewed the potential effects of economic downturns on overall health, to our knowledge such an analysis has yet to be done focusing on infectious diseases. We performed a systematic literature review of studies examining changes in infectious disease burden subsequent to periods of crisis. The review identified 230 studies of which 37 met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 30 found evidence of worse infectious disease outcomes during recession, often resulting from higher rates of infectious contact under poorer living circumstances, worsened access to therapy, or poorer retention in treatment. The remaining studies found either reductions in infectious disease or no significant effect. Using the paradigm of the "SIR" (susceptible-infected-recovered) model of infectious disease transmission, we examined the implications of these findings for infectious disease transmission and control. Key susceptible groups include infants and the elderly. We identified certain high-risk groups, including migrants, homeless persons, and prison populations, as particularly vulnerable conduits of epidemics during situations of economic duress. We also observed that the long-term impacts of crises on infectious disease are not inevitable: considerable evidence suggests that the magnitude of effect depends critically on budgetary responses by governments. Like other emergencies and natural disasters, preparedness for financial crises should include consideration of consequences for communicable disease control. © 2011 Suhrcke et al.

N2  - Background: The cause of the high HIV prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa is incompletely understood, with heterosexual penile-vaginal transmission proposed as the main mechanism. Heterosexual HIV transmission has been estimated to have a very low probability; but effects of cofactors that vary in space and time may substantially alter this pattern. Method(s): To test the effect of individual variation in the HIV infectiousness generated by co-infection, we developed and analyzed a mathematical sexual network model that simulates the behavioral components of a population from Malawi, as well as the dynamics of HIV and the co-infection effect caused by other infectious diseases, including herpes simplex virus type-2, gonorrhea, syphilis and malaria. Result(s): The analysis shows that without the amplification effect caused by co-infection, no epidemic is generated, and HIV prevalence decreases to extinction. But the model indicates that an epidemic can be generated by the amplification effect on HIV transmission caused by co-infection. Conclusion(s): The simulated sexual network demonstrated that a single value for HIV infectivity fails to describe the dynamics of the epidemic. Regardless of the low probability of heterosexual transmission per sexual contact, the inclusion of individual variation generated by transient but repeated increases in HIV viral load associated with co-infections may provide a biological basis for the accelerated spread of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, our work raises the possibility that the natural history of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa cannot be fully understood if individual variation in infectiousness is neglected. © 2011 Cuadros et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

T1  - Low adherence to influenza vaccination campaigns: Is the H1N1 virus pandemic to be blamed?
A1  - Trivellin V.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Background: Over the last few months, debates about the handling of the influenza virus A (H1N1) pandemic took place, in particular regarding the change of the WHO pandemic definition, economic interests, the dramatic communication style of mass media. The activation of plans to reduce the virus diffusion resulted in an important investment of resources. Were those investments proportionate to the risk? Was the pandemic overrated? The workload of the Pediatric Emergency Room (P.E.R.) at a teaching hospital in Varese (Northern Italy) was investigated in order to evaluate the local diffusion and severity of the new H1N1 influenza epidemic. Discussion. A 100% increase of the number of P.E.R. visits, particularly for influenza-like illness, was recorded during weeks 42-46 of 2009 (October, 17 to November, 2); the low rate of hospitalization and the mild presentation of the infection gave rise to the conclusion that the pandemic risk was overrated. Mass media communications concerning the new virus created a disproportionate fear in the population that significantly enhanced the burden of cares at the hospital. In the absence of generally implemented measures for etiological diagnosis, the actual incidence of the H1N1 infection could not be estimated. Virus identification, in fact, was limited to children showing severe symptoms after consultancy with an infectious disease specialist. The alarming nature of the communication campaign and the choice to limit etiologic diagnosis to severe cases created a climate of uncertainty which significantly contributed to the massive admissions to the P.E.R. Summary. The communication strategy adopted by the mass media was an important element during the pandemic: the absence of clarity contributed to the spread of a pandemic phobia that appeared to result more from the sensationalism of the campaign than from infection with the novel influenza A variant of human, avian, swine origin virus. One relevant effect of the media coverage was the extremely low adherence rate to the vaccination campaign for the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, especially among the high- risk population and health care workers. One positive consequence was, however, the spread of preventive hygiene measures, such as hand washing. © 2011 Trivellin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes outbreaks of severe disease in domestic ungulates as well as humans in Africa. There is a concern that outbreaks of Rift Valley fever may continue and that this virus may spread into regions where it had not previously been detected. Surveillance and rapid detection are critical to the initiation of an effective disease control program. Here we report on the field evaluation in Kenya of the VectorTest RVFV antigen assay, modeled on the VecTest assay for West Nile virus. The dipsticks provided results in <20 min, were easy to use, and did not require a laboratory with containment facilities. Although none of the field-collected mosquitoes were infected with RVFV, the dipstick provided a clear positive result with pools of field-collected mosquitoes spiked with a single positive, irradiated (to inactivate any infectious virus) mosquito. Similarly, the dipstick was able to detect virus from pools of mosquitoes captured during the RVFV outbreak in 2007. The RVFV dipstick assay was highly specific with only a single weak false positive out of 266 pools tested (specificity > 99.6%). The RVFV assay can provide a rapid, safe, easy-to-use preliminary test to alert public health personnel to the presence of RVFV in mosquitoes in a given area. Results from this assay will allow for more rapid medical threat assessments and the focusing of vector control measures on high-risk areas. © 2011 by The American Mosquito Control Association, Inc.

T1  - Consequences of non-intervention for infectious disease in African great apes
A1  - Ryan S.J.
A1  - Walsh P.D. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Infectious disease has recently joined poaching and habitat loss as a major threat to African apes. Both "naturally" occurring pathogens, such as Ebola and Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), and respiratory pathogens transmitted from humans, have been confirmed as important sources of mortality in wild gorillas and chimpanzees. While awareness of the threat has increased, interventions such as vaccination and treatment remain controversial. Here we explore both the risk of disease to African apes, and the status of potential responses. Through synthesis of published data, we summarize prior disease impact on African apes. We then use a simple demographic model to illustrate the resilience of a well-known gorilla population to disease, modeled on prior documented outbreaks. We found that the predicted recovery time for this specific gorilla population from a single outbreak ranged from 5 years for a low mortality (4%) respiratory outbreak, to 131 years for an Ebola outbreak that killed 96% of the population. This shows that mortality rates comparable to those recently reported for disease outbreaks in wild populations are not sustainable. This is particularly troubling given the rising pathogen risk created by increasing habituation of wild apes for tourism, and the growth of human populations surrounding protected areas. We assess potential future disease spillover risk in terms of vaccination rates amongst humans that may come into contact with wild apes, and the availability of vaccines against potentially threatening diseases. We discuss and evaluate non-interventionist responses such as limiting tourist access to apes, community health programs, and safety, logistic, and cost issues that constrain the potential of vaccination. © 2011 Ryan and Walsh.

T1  - Concurrency revisited: Increasing and compelling epidemiological evidence
A1  - Mah T.L.
A1  - Shelton J.D. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Multiple sexual partnerships must necessarily lie at the root of a sexually transmitted epidemic. However, that overlapping or concurrent partnerships have played a pivotal role in the generalized epidemics of sub-Saharan Africa has been challenged. Much of the original proposition that concurrent partnerships play such a role focused on modelling, self-reported sexual behaviour data and ethnographic data. While each of these has definite merit, each also has had methodological limitations. Actually, more recent cross-national sexual behaviour data and improved modelling have strengthened these lines of evidence. However, heretofore the epidemiologic evidence has not been systematically brought to bear. Though assessing the epidemiologic evidence regarding concurrency has its challenges, a careful examination, especially of those studies that have assessed HIV incidence, clearly indicates a key role for concurrency. Such evidence includes: 1) the early and dramatic rise of HIV infection in generalized epidemics that can only arise from transmission through rapid sequential acute infections and thereby concurrency; 2) clear evidence from incidence studies that a major portion of transmission in the population occurs via concurrency both for concordant negative and discordant couples; 3) elevation in risk associated with partner's multiple partnering; 4) declines in HIV associated with declines in concurrency; 5) bursts and clustering of incident infections that indicate concurrency and acute infection play a key role in the propagation of epidemics; and 6) a lack of other plausible explanations, including serial monogamy and non-sexual transmission. While other factors, such as sexually transmitted infections, other infectious diseases, biological factors and HIV sub-type, likely play a role in enhancing transmission, it appears most plausible that these would amplify the role of concurrency rather than alter it. Additionally, critics of concurrency have not proposed plausible alternative explanations for why the explosive generalized epidemics occurred. Specific behaviour change messaging bringing the concepts of multiple partnering and concurrency together appears salient and valid in promoting safer individual behaviour and positive social norms. © 2011 Mah and Shelton; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - International outbreaks are occurring much faster than before and require rapid trans-national detection and response. Never before has there been a more urgent need for improved crossborder collaboration on harmonisation of surveillance and response systems despite varying legislations. In the Euregion Maas Rhine, the Public Health Services of South Limburg in the Netherlands and Aachen in Germany agreed to join forces to work on a collaborative tool for sharing real-time infectious disease data. Both units had already implemented an adapted version of HPZone (a web-based software suite for managing infectious diseases at the local level). The collaborative work was realised through finding solutions to five key challenges. First, Euregional disease protocols were agreed commensurate with national guidelines. Secondly, a minimal dataset for infectious disease exchange information was negotiated taking into consideration international health regulations and differences in legislation. Thirdly, a mature risk assessment model for infectious disease was augmented to account for transborder spread and Euregional impact. Fourthly, protocol alert rules were negotiated on triggers for early warning. Finally, a crossborder dashboard, as a component of HPVista and encapsulating the four previous deliverables into a secure web-based system, was developed. HPVista is the parent application to HPZone and enables wider incident command and control regionally, nationally and internationally. The dashboard has facilities for displaying what, when, where and how cases, contacts and outbreaks happen in the crossborder area. It also provides secure communications for further discussion and exchange of other key information not currently shared electronically. The collaborative work embedded in the modified HPZone and HPVista versions with real-time surveillance and geographical information system mapping readily facilitates the systematic analysis of crossborder health incidents in a continuously changing environment and will result in improved public health emergency management.

T1  - The risk of success: cultural determinants of chronic disease and sexually transmitted infections among urban Chinese men
A1  - Uretsky E. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - During the 1950s and 1960s, the People's Republic of China successfully waged a series of public health campaigns to control the infectious diseases that were ravaging them as a nation. This included a campaign that targeted the social roots of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). China is now facing a new disease profile that includes emerging epidemics of chronic disease as well as reemerging epidemics of STIs. Many of these diseases are strongly associated with gender and occupation, suggesting need for a critical model of health literacy that recognizes the role of social risk in promoting risky behaviors rather than focusing on a simple model that disseminates knowledge about biomedical risk. Such a model is useful for explaining why people armed with knowledge about biomedical risk continue to engage in risky behaviors. This article focuses on the social risks that wealthy Chinese businessmen and government officials negotiate on a daily basis. It highlights the concept of guanxi that is so central to building relationships in China and explains the traditional process of yingchou used to establish and maintain relationships among this cadre of men who depend on one another for political and economic success. This process, which has become pervasive in China's era of market reform, requires men to engage in frequent practices of smoking, drinking, eating and female-centered entertainment that are contributing both to their success and to their increasing vulnerability to chronic disease and STIs. The paper concludes by offering some alternative approaches to addressing this emerging disease pattern among this particular segment of China's population.

N2  - Background: Advanced technical systems and analytic methods promise to provide policy makers with information to help them recognize the consequences of alternative courses of action during pandemics. Evaluations still show that response programs are insufficiently supported by information systems. This paper sets out to derive a protocol for implementation of integrated information infrastructures supporting regional and local pandemic response programs at the stage(s) when the outbreak no longer can be contained at its source. Method(s): Nominal group methods for reaching consensus on complex problems were used to transform requirements data obtained from international experts into an implementation protocol. The analysis was performed in a cyclical process in which the experts first individually provided input to working documents and then discussed them in conferences calls. Argument-based representation in design patterns was used to define the protocol at technical, system, and pandemic evidence levels. Result(s): The Protocol for a Standardized information infrastructure for Pandemic and Emerging infectious disease Response (PROSPER) outlines the implementation of information infrastructure aligned with pandemic response programs. The protocol covers analyses of the community at risk, the response processes, and response impacts. For each of these, the protocol outlines the implementation of a supporting information infrastructure in hierarchical patterns ranging from technical components and system functions to pandemic evidence production. Conclusion(s): The PROSPER protocol provides guidelines for implementation of an information infrastructure for pandemic response programs both in settings where sophisticated health information systems already are used and in developing communities where there is limited access to financial and technical resources. The protocol is based on a generic health service model and its functions are adjusted for community-level analyses of outbreak detection and progress, and response program effectiveness. Scientifically grounded reporting principles need to be established for interpretation of information derived from outbreak detection algorithms and predictive modeling. © 2011 Timpka et al.

N2  - The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center, Division of Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System Operations (AFHSC-GEIS) initiated a coordinated, multidisciplinary program to link data sets and information derived from eco-climatic remote sensing activities, ecologic niche modeling, arthropod vector, animal disease-host/reservoir, and human disease surveillance for febrile illnesses, into a predictive surveillance program that generates advisories and alerts on emerging infectious disease outbreaks. The program's ultimate goal is pro-active public health practice through pre-event preparedness, prevention and control, and response decision-making and prioritization. This multidisciplinary program is rooted in over 10 years experience in predictive surveillance for Rift Valley fever outbreaks in Eastern Africa. The AFHSC-GEIS Rift Valley fever project is based on the identification and use of disease-emergence critical detection points as reliable signals for increased outbreak risk. The AFHSC-GEIS predictive surveillance program has formalized the Rift Valley fever project into a structured template for extending predictive surveillance capability to other Department of Defense (DoD)-priority vector- and water-borne, and zoonotic diseases and geographic areas. These include leishmaniasis, malaria, and Crimea-Congo and other viral hemorrhagic fevers in Central Asia and Africa, dengue fever in Asia and the Americas, Japanese encephalitis (JE) and chikungunya fever in Asia, and rickettsial and other tick-borne infections in the U.S., Africa and Asia.

N2  - Variant CJD (vCJD) is an incurable, infectious human disease, likely arising from the consumption of BSE-contaminated meat products. Whilst the epidemic appears to be waning, there is much concern that vCJD infection may be perpetuated in humans by the transfusion of contaminated blood products. Since 2004, several cases of transfusion-associated vCJD transmission have been reported and linked to blood collected from pre-clinically affected donors. Using an animal model in which the disease manifested resembles that of humans affected with vCJD, we examined which blood components used in human medicine are likely to pose the greatest risk of transmitting vCJD via transfusion. We collected two full units of blood from BSE-infected donor animals during the pre-clinical phase of infection. Using methods employed by transfusion services we prepared red cell concentrates, plasma and platelets units (including leucoreduced equivalents). Following transfusion, we showed that all components contain sufficient levels of infectivity to cause disease following only a single transfusion and also that leucoreduction did not prevent disease transmission. These data suggest that all blood components are vectors for prion disease transmission, and highlight the importance of multiple control measures to minimise the risk of human to human transmission of vCJD by blood transfusion. © 2011 McCutcheon et al.

N2  - White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a fatal disease of bats that hibernate. The etiologic agent of WNS is the fungus Geomyces destructans, which infects the skin and wing membranes. Over 1 million bats in six species in eastern North America have died from WNS since 2006, and as a result several species of bats may become endangered or extinct. Information is lacking on the pathogenesis of G. destructans and WNS, WNS transmission and maintenance, individual and site factors that contribute to the probability of an outbreak of WNS, and spatial dynamics of WNS spread in North America. We considered how descriptive and analytical epidemiology could be used to fill these information gaps, including a four-step (modified) outbreak investigation, application of a set of criteria (Hill's) for assessing causation, compartment models of disease dynamics, and spatial modeling. We cataloged and critiqued adaptive-management options that have been either previously proposed for WNS or were helpful in addressing other emerging diseases of wild animals. These include an ongoing program of prospective surveillance of bats and hibernacula for WNS, treatment of individual bats, increasing population resistance to WNS (through vaccines, immunomodulators, or other methods), improving probability of survival from starvation and dehydration associated with WNS, modifying hibernacula environments to eliminate G. destructans, culling individuals or populations, controlling anthropogenic spread of WNS, conserving genetic diversity of bats, and educating the public about bats and bat conservation issues associated with WNS. ©2011 Society for Conservation Biology.

N2  - Hospital hygiene faces cross-cutting and methodological challenges that are time consuming and require specialised knowledge. In outbreak situations German federal states can request assistance from infectious disease epidemiologists at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). The presented study describes the successful collaboration of local hygienists, microbiologists, clinicians, health authorities and the epidemiologists of the RKI in the investigation of an outbreak of multidrug-resistant Enterobacter (E.) cloacae in 2009 in a children's hospital. The outbreak was discovered in July 2009 when E. cloacae was detected in 12 patients in the neonatal and paediatric intensive care unit (NICU). Hygiene measures were intensified for infection control, and the RKI was invited by the responsible regional health authorities in October 2009 to assist in the outbreak investigation. We conducted a retrospective matched case-control study to identify risk factors for E. cloacae colonisation and infection. We identified a case as any child in the NICU from 1st May to 5th October 2009 with laboratory confirmation of the outbreak clone. Controls were patients staying in the NICU (> 72 h before the case's diagnosis) and swab-negative for the outbreak clone. We used standardised questionnaires to collect demographic and medical information. Matched odds ratios (mOR) were calculated by bivariate and multivariable conditional logistic regression. Environmental investigations were conducted. We identified 28 colonised and 3 bacteraemic cases. 29 matched case-control pairs were included in the study. Multivariable analysis revealed an association between E. cloacae diagnosis and the receipt of oral drugs at the bed-side from multidose packaging (mOR=1.8/drug; p=0.006). No specific drug was identified; microbiological investigation of drugs was negative. This multiresistant E. cloacae outbreak was most likely distributed by oral application using contaminated multidose drug packaging extrinsically contaminated via hands of personnel. No further cases occurred for 6 weeks after protocols for handling oral drugs were changed (smaller packaging, patient-based storage, and limited circulation time). Special attention and thorough hygiene protocols are needed for the distribution of oral medication. In NICUs the use of multi-dose medications should be avoided. The cooperation between locally available expertise and infectious disease epidemiologists enabled the discovery of a previously unidentified risk factor. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

T1  - Development of a Self-Regulated Dynamic Model for the Propagation of Salmonella Typhimurium in Pig Farms
A1  - Soumpasis I.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - A self-regulated epidemic model was developed to describe the dynamics of Salmonella Typhimurium in pig farms and predict the prevalence of different risk groups at slaughter age. The model was focused at the compartment level of the pig farms and it included two syndromes, a high and a low propagation syndrome. These two syndromes generated two different classes of pigs, the High Infectious and the Low Infectious, respectively, which have different shedding patterns. Given the two different classes and syndromes, the Infectious Equivalent concept was used, which reflected the combination of High and Low Infectious pigs needed for the high propagation syndrome to be triggered. Using the above information a new algorithm was developed that decides, depending on the Infectious Equivalent, which of the two syndromes should be triggered. Results showed that the transmission rate of S. Typhimurium for the low propagation syndrome is around 0.115, pigs in Low Infectious class contribute to the transmission of the infection by 0.61-0.80 of pigs in High Infectious class and that the Infectious Equivalent should be above 10-14% of the population in order for the high propagation syndrome to be triggered. This self-regulated dynamic model can predict the prevalence of the classes and the risk groups of pigs at slaughter age for different starting conditions of infection. © 2010 Society for Risk Analysis.

N2  - Concerns about public health risks of intensive animal production in The Netherlands continue to rise, in particular related to outbreaks of infectious diseases such as Q-fever. An increased risk of asthma among neighboring residents is a specific concern raised by general practitioners (GPs) in areas with high animal densities. The aim was to study respiratory health effects among individuals living in the vicinity of animal farms. Electronic medical record data for the year 2009 of all patients of 27 GPs in a region with a high density of animal farms were used. Density of animal farms around the home address was calculated using a Geographic Information System. Associations between farm exposure variables and respiratory diseases were analyzed in 22.406 children (0-17 y) and 70.142 adults (18-70 y), adjusting for age, sex, and household income. During the study period, a Q-fever outbreak occurred in this region. "Possible Q-fever" was defined as a diagnosis of pneumonia or other infectious disease - the diagnosis code used by GPs for registration of suspected Q-fever. Proximity to farms and modeled farm-related particulate matter (PM10) exposure were inversely associated with asthma, COPD, upper respiratory tract infections, and hay fever, whereas the same farm exposure variables were positively associated with possible Q-fever (all P<0.05). The presence of goat and sheep within 1 km of the home address was associated with possible Q-fever in adults (goat: OR 1.3; 95%CI 1.1-1.4, sheep: OR 1.3; 95%CI 1.1-1.5). Both protective and adverse health effects among individuals living near animal farms were observed. These findings should be confirmed with diagnostic measures before firm conclusions can be drawn.

N2  - Background/Aims: Traditionally, the effectiveness of hygiene interventions-hand washing, respirator use, and cough etiquette-have been explored through mechanistic exposure models within a quantitative risk assessment framework; whereas the effectiveness of social distancing interventions has been explored using epidemiologic models. We present an approach, inspired by Larson (2007), in which the transition from Susceptible to Infected group in the SIR epidemiologic model is based on infection probabilities determined by exposure/risk models, rather than a reproductive number. Method(s): Monte Carlo simulation of a Markov model of influenza exposure and infection risk provides estimates of infection probabilities for selected contact scenarios. Hygiene interventions are included in the exposure/risk model, altering the infection probabilities. The infection probabilities define the transition from Susceptible to Infection in the standardized incidence ratios epidemiologic model. For illustration purposes, we use 2 population strata, with high and low contact rates, respectively; and model the impact of social distancing interventions by modifying the number of people in each strata, and their contact rates. Given repeated model simulation, the epidemic dynamics resulting from different interventions and compliance rates, the can be compared to select the intervention(s) which minimize costs and maximize health risks, given uncertainties about influenza exposure and infection risk. Result(s): This new methodological approach will be illustrated using a simple scenario. Conclusion(s): The advantages of this approach are the direct comparison of hygiene and social distancing interventions, and explicit treatment of influenza as an environmentally mediated disease, for which the risk of infection is highly dependent upon the type and magnitude of contact between susceptible and infectious persons.

N2  - Background/Aims: We describe an outbreak of influenza A in a hospital ward in Hong Kong and explore the possible role of aerosol transmission. Method(s): Epidemiological data were collected during the investigation of a nosocomial outbreak in the hospital ward. Spatiotemporal analyses were performed to examine the risk of infection among hospitalized patients in the ward during the infectious period of the index case. Detailed airflow measurements were carried out, and the distribution of a hypothetical virus-laden aerosol source from the index patient at different locations of the ward was estimated using computational fluid dynamics modeling. Result(s): The overall attack rate of influenza among inpatients was 15.3% (9/59). It was 23.8%, 22.2%, and 0% in the same, adjacent, and distant cubicles, respectively (P = 0.022). Staying in the same and adjacent cubicles on the day when the index case was put on noninvasive ventilation support was independently associated with increased risk of acquiring influenza (odds ratio = 17.0; 95% CI: 2.0, 147.7; P = 0.01). The supply air velocities of the air purifier unit placed next to the index patient was found to dominate the airflow pattern, causing a directional airflow in the ward. Computation fluid dynamics modeling suggested that dispersal of the hypothetical virusladen aerosols into the same and adjacent cubicles corresponded to the locations of affected inpatients. Conclusion(s): Results of the study suggest a role of aerosol transmission of influenza virus in the hospital outbreak. Cautious use of aerosol-generating devices and controlling airflow patterns in the hospital wards may need to be implemented.

N2  - Background/Aims: Events and intensities of extreme precipitation appeared to have increased over the recent time. Little characterization has been established between extreme precipitations and reporting climaterelated infectious diseases in a subtropical region like Taiwan. Method(s): The daily precipitation, temperature data, and registry data of infectious diseases, including intestinal, vector-borne, and flood-related infections, were integrated from 352 townships in Taiwan. The study period spanned from 1994 to 2008. The daily accumulated rainfall of more than 130 mm, 200 mm, and 350 mm was categorized as heavy rain, torrential rain, and extreme torrential rain, respectively. The relationship between level of precipitation and reporting cases of specific infectious diseases was analyzed with generalized additive mixed model and further mapped by geographical information system. Result(s): Preliminary suggested that increased precipitation was associated with the higher risk of reporting intestinal and flood-related infectious diseases. The daily accumulated rainfall up to 200-350 mm, the incidence of vector-borne infections would increase 2-10 folds; the same type of risk would, however, drop as the daily accumulated rainfall went more than 350 mm because the habitats of vectors could have been destroyed by extreme rainfall of this intensity. Conclusion(s): Changing patterns of precipitation were shown to affect the occurrence of climate-related infectious diseases in Taiwan. However, variation in distributions of medical resources or sanitary infrastructures would have to be taken into account in further analyses before concluding the relationship between the climatic changes and infectious epidemics.

N2  - Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes outbreaks of severe disease in domestic ungulates as well as humans in Africa. There is a concern that outbreaks of RVF may continue and that this virus may spread into regions where it had not previously been detected. Surveillance and rapid detection are critical to the initiation of an effective disease control program. Here we report on the feld evaluation in Kenya of the VectorTest RVFV antigen assay, modeled on the VecTest assay for West Nile virus. The dipsticks provided results in less than 20 min, were easy to use, and did not require a laboratory with containment facilities. Although none of the feld-collected mosquitoes were infected with RVFV, the dipstick provided a clear positive result with pools of feld-collected mosquitoes spiked with a single positive, irradiated (to inactivate an infectious virus) mosquito. Similarly, the dipstick was able to detect virus from pools of mosquitoes captured during the RVFV outbreak in 2007. The RVFV dipstick assay was highly specifc with only a single weak false positive out of 266 pools tested (specifcity >99.6%). The RVFV assay can provide a rapid, safe, easy to use preliminary test to alert public health personnel to the presence of RVFV in mosquitoes in a given area. Results from this assay will allow for more rapid medical threat assessments and the focusing of vector control measures on high-risk areas.

N2  - Knowledge of human mobility and how it infuences pathogen transmission remains limited, especially at fne scales. We studied the importance of individual human movements, measured in terms of exposure to pathogen, for predicting risk of infection with dengue virus (DENV) over two transmission seasons dominated by DENV-4 in Iquitos, Peru. We used a survey to identify locations visited recently by 48 febrile individuals (23 DENV+, 25 DENV- controls) and sampled for evidence of acute dengue infection (RT-PCR, IgM ELISA) among contacts residing in those locations. Overall, we identifed 97 total acute (PCR+ or IgM seroconversion) infections and 77 recent (elevated acute IgM) infections in 166 households (mean 3 contact houses per index case), 31% of which occurred >100m from the home. These data and serotype-specifc plaque reduction neutralization test results from a prospective longitudinal cohort were then used to parameterize risk and attack rate models. Based on a simple theoretical model, we estimated exposure as a composite index of the number of recently visited locations with concurrent acute DENV infections, and the number of acute infections and susceptible hosts per location. We show that risk of infection with DENV is overwhelmingly driven by variation in exposure (P<0.001) and herd immunity (P<0.05). Attack rates in the activity spaces of DENV+ cases were markedly higher than DENV- controls (17% [95% CI:12-21%] vs 6% [95% CI:3-8%]), with no difference in household incidence between the home and contact sites of DENV+ clusters (16.9%). We conclude that human mobility is central to the transmission of this virus and for predicting who and what locations are at greatest risk for infection with DENV during an outbreak. We discuss the implications of our results for the design of dengue control and surveillance programs and argue our fndings and methods are not specifc to DENV and are relevant to understanding other infectious diseases.

N2  - Purpose: The U.S. CDC estimates over 5.4 million norovirus infections annually in the U.S., and numerous others among international travelers. Noroviruses cause numerous outbreaks, outpatient visits and nearly 15,000 hospitalizations and 150 deaths each year. While the burden associated with the acute consequences of norovirus are sizeable, emerging data suggests norovirus may be associated with chronic gastrointestinal problems. However, no studies looking at pathogen-specific norovirus post-infectious risks have been reported. We identified known outbreaks in Department of Defense (DOD) recruits and utilized the DOD Medical Encounter Database (DMED) to identify the risk of new onset functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGD) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Method(s): Subjects reporting for norovirus-related care during three known norovirus outbreaks were identified from the DMED. Each AGE case was matched with up to four subjects with unrelated medical encounters. Medical encounter history was analyzed for the duration of military service time (or a minimum of 1 year) to assess for incident FGD or GERD. Relative risks were calculated using Poisson regression models to determine the relationship between pathogen-attributable gastroenteritis and each post-infectious sequelae while controlling for important covariates. Result(s): We identified 1,718 cases from 3 separate norovirus outbreaks among recruits (Jan - Feb 04, San Diego, CA: 203; Dec - Apr 05, San Diego, CA: 1360; Jan - Feb 07, Parris Island, SC: 155). After controlling for covariates, the incidence of constipation, dyspepsia and GERD was approximately 1.5 fold higher (p<0.01) in outbreak-associated AGE cases than in matched subjects without an outbreak associated AGE illness, though noted significant variability in the incidence of FGD and GERD among outbreak subjects across the three studied outbreaks. Conclusion(s): This is the first study which reports risk of post-norovirus infectious sequelae in a generally healthy population and finds that risk of dyspepsia, constipation and GERD are higher among those who have AGE during a confirmed norovirus outbreak compared to non-ill controls. Relatively little is known about the pathogenesis of norovirus, and while these findings should be confirmed in additional studies, they suggest that dysmotility may result subsequent to these infections. Further studies are needed to evaluate the possible transient nature of such post-infectious sequelae and if risk differs based on infections with different genotypes. If confirmed, the costs associated with the chronic consequences of norovirus should be considered in the enhanced implementation of control measures in outbreaks and high risk populations.

N2  - Evidence of an association between survival time and date of birth would suggest an etiologic role for a seasonally variable environmental exposure occurring within a narrow perinatal time period. Risk factors that may exhibit seasonal epidemicity include diet, infectious agents, allergens, and antihistamine use. Typically data has been analyzed by simply categorizing births into months or seasons of the year and performing multiple pairwise comparisons. This paper present a statistically robust alternative, based upon a trigonometric Cox regression model, to analyze the cyclic nature of birth dates related to patient survival. Disease birth-date results are presented using a sinusoidal plot with peak date(s) of relative risk and a single P value that indicates whether an overall statistically significant seasonal association is present. Advantages of this derivative-free method include ease of use, increased power to detect statistically significant associations, and the ability to avoid arbitrary, subjective demarcation of seasons.

N2  - Rapid response to emerging infectious disease and laboratory accidents represents an important and novel application of AVI BioPharma's RNA therapeutic platform. AVI's phosphorodiamidate morpholino oliogmer (PMO) approach to rapid response relies upon multiple favorable properties of these compounds and a growing database of positive studies with a wide variety of infectious disease agents. AVI has demonstrated efficacy for our synthetic oligomers in cell culture for 19 different viral families and in vivo efficacy in 11 of those families. This experience has reinforced the value of our therapeutic design strategies. The exceptionally high success rate in animal infection challenge studies indicates a high probability of therapeutic development success. In 2001 we responded to lethal outbreaks of feline calicivirus in Atlanta, GA and Eugene, OR resulting in 94% (47/50) survival in treated kittens compared to 9.7% (3/31) survival untreated kittens. In 2002, within 14 days we progressed from concept to the successful treatment of Humboldt Penguins infected with West Nile (100% survival of treated birds). In 2004 we responded to an accident with Ebola Zaire to a laboratory worker which progressed from concept to delivery of clinical supply in 7 days. Studies confirming PMOplus efficacy have been conducted in lethal challenge animal models involving mouse, guinea pig and nonhuman primates. More recently, AVI participated in a rapid response exercise involving H1N1 influenza in 2009 in which progress from concept to compound took 7 days. PMOplus efficacy was demonstrated in both mouse and ferret animal models. In 2010, AVI undertook a rapid response exercise involving Dengue virus where the time from request to an effective PMOplus compound was 11 days. Supportive nonclincial programs have led to open INDs for AVI-6002 for Ebola Zaire, AVI-6003 for Marburgvirus and AVI-7100 for influenza A. Studies are currently in progress to expand the rapid response capability to include multidrug resistant bacterial infections. We conclude that AVI's RNA therapeutic technology is well suited to rapid therapeutic response.

N2  - Heterogeneity in infectiousness duration can affect epidemiological patterns and outbreak risk. Norovirus, a common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis, demonstrates this type of heterogeneity; some individuals asymptomatically shed viral particles for much longer than the rest of the population. We reviewed the literature for human norovirus shedding duration data. These data were used to develop realistic infectious period distributions and to examine characteristics of individuals who shed for longer durations. Infants and those with compromised immune systems are more likely to shed longer, and are classified as long-shedders. With a mathematical model, increases in the proportion of long-shedders or in their average infectiousness duration results in longer outbreaks and a higher probability of outbreak occurrence. Long shedders can affect outbreak patterns similar to environmental reservoirs such as water, and should therefore be taken into account when developing control strategies and microbial risk assessment models.

N2  - The study of infectious disease co-epidemics is critical to understanding how the diseases are related and how prevention and treatment efforts can be most effective. A co-epidemic arises when the spread of one infectious disease stimulates the spread of another infectious disease. Basic models can provide insight into the complicated infection dynamics, and into effective control measures. Most epidemic models estimate a single disease. In present situation human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) infection together form a very crucial public health hazard. It is also hypothesized that persons infected with the tubercle bacillus are at an increased risk of developing clinical disease if they become infected with HIV. WHO has given alarming estimates of HIV related tuberculosis in developing countries where tuberculosis is now recognized as one of the most common opportunistic diseases among persons seropositive for HIV. We present a general epidemic model of the two infectious disease coepidemics that we use to explore the effects of hypothetical prevention and treatment scenarios. This model demonstrates that exclusively treating first infectious disease or second infectious disease may reduce the targeted epidemic, but can consequently intensify the other epidemic. This is useful for two synergistic infectious disease epidemics show the importance of including the effects of each disease on the diffusion and evolution of the other infection.

N2  - The inevitability of global climate change has led to concerns about its effects on the incidence and distribution of infectious disease risk, but studies thus far have usually focused on one disease in a limited geographic region. Here we present the first results of a study aimed at broadly characterizing the global effects of climate on the risk and burden of a range of infectious diseases. Using dengue as an initial proof of concept, we developed subnational scale spatial risk models that predict established endemic areas and zones of ongoing emergence. We overcame limitations in the granularity of global surveillance information by coupling data from HealthMap, an automated surveillance system that collects event-based information at a global scale, with traditional dengue surveillance data. We estimated a surface of HealthMap dengue report density with a Gaussian mixture model and quantitatively compared this with established endemic zones to define and then cross-validate areas of expansion in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Future steps for this study include development of spatial models to characterize the effects of climate on dengue expansion and the application of long-term climate change scenarios for forecasting. The ultimate products of this study will be real-time, global risk assessments for a range of diseases useful for improving prevention and control efforts, resource allocation and arming clinicians and the public with enhanced epidemic intelligence.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Current influenza like illness (ILI) monitoring in Idaho is based on syndromic surveillance using laboratory data combined with periodic person-to-person reports collected by state workers. This system also relies on voluntary reporting from physicians, schools and other institutions. Electronic medical records (EMRs) offer a method of obtaining data in an automated fashion. The Veterans Administration EMR (CPRS) captures real-time visit information, vital signs, ICD-9, pharmacy and lab data. EMR surveillance has been utilized for syndromic surveillance on a regional level. Funds supporting expansion of EMRs offer increased ability for use in biosurveillance. The addition of temporo-spatial modeling may improve identification of clusters of cases. This abstract reviews our efforts to develop a real time system of identifying ILI in Idaho using VA data and temporo-spatial techniques. METHOD(S): The Boise Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) provides care to over 20,000 veterans living in Idaho with clinics in Boise, Caldwell, Twin Falls, Salmon, ID and Burns, OR. Using retrospective data from the Veterans Integrated Service Network 20 (VISN 20) data warehouse for the 2008-2009 influenza season, we identified ILI cases from these clinics using ICD-9 codes collected as weekly counts. Duplicates and incompletes were removed; zip code was extracted; clusters less than 5 per zip code were suppressed. We used SatScan v9.0.1 for cluster analysis with MonteCarlo simulation for an expected incidence based on distribution of sample overtime and space; geographic extent of cluster was not limited. We used ArcMap 10 for visualization based on US Census Map data. The VA Puget Sound IRB approved this study. RESULT(S): We identified one primary and one significant secondary cluster (p<0.05) of ILI (Figure 1). The relative risk was 7.8 for ILI in the primary cluster identified in southeast Idaho over a month-long period 7/17/09 to 8/20/09. The secondary cluster in west central Idaho occurred over a shorter two week period in January. These results were shared with Idaho Public Health District directors, who confirmed the existence of an ILI cluster in southeast Idaho; the site of the primary cluster. We sampled a small percent of the state population; women and children are underrepresented. (Figure Presented) CONCLUSION(S): Retrospective data obtained from VA electronic health records appears to be useful in locating ILI outbreaks in space and time. Further work is needed to evaluate the ability of our system to identify outbreaks in real time, and to determine the extent to which our system may complement existing surveillance techniques. Temporo-spatial modeling may also have applications in monitoring the spatial distribution of the incidence and control of chronic diseases.

N2  - Objectives: Prior to 2010, various disparate systems have been in use in England for the control of infectious disease resulting in significant challenges for consistent and timely reporting, surveillance and response. With the rise of emerging diseases, there is an urgent need for: 1. a single national decision support system to strengthen frontline infectious disease control; 2. a seemless integration with the laboratories; 3. a real-time overarching view of all infectious disease control at local, regional and nationals levels. Method(s): The work began with the development of a dynamic risk assessment model for Infectious disease embedded in a pilot Decision Support System (DSS) conceived via various regional and national Delphi workshops. Challenges encountered included standards, changing notification legislation, clinical governance, articulation of national workflows, collection of national reference data sets and integration with other software suites including the laboratories. Result(s): The research has resulted in the design, development and implementation of the following web-based tools: 1. HPZone: a DSS for the management of Enquiries, Cases and Outbreaks at 26 Local Units readily providing consistent data. Basic coincidence and threshold alerts are built in so appropriate information is automatically brought to the attention of those who need to know. 2. HPZone-Cosurv interface: A module which automatically harvests laboratory data from encrypted emails and incorporates them into HPZone with tight rules for data insertion. 3. Dashboard: a module providing aggregate Case and Outbreak data collected and presented in different views including geographic, temporal and disease specific. Consideration has been given to key types of data that are informative to those charged with surveillance and incident management at local, regional and national levels. Conclusion(s): The three tools offer immediate benefits in providing key User defined data, enhanced visibility of real-time critical data for prompt response, and a ready opportunity for surveillance and epidemiological research regionally and nationally. The involvement of frontline users has improved tools' ownership amongst all users and has paved the way for more work on data sharing regionally and nationally in time for the Olympic games in 2012.

N2  - Background: The German Red Cross Blood Donor Service Baden-Wuerttemberg - Hessen introduced mini-pool nucleic acid testing (MP-NAT) for hepatitis B virus on a voluntary basis in 1997. All blood donors were screened in addition for HBsAG. Although all blood donors were screened by MP-NAT and HBsAG, some cases of transfusion transmitted hepatitis B infections were reported based on low viremic occult hepatitis B infected blood donors. Therefore the German authority introduced anti-HBc blood donor screening in 2006 for all blood donations. Aim(s): The current study reports about the experience with anti-HBc blood donor screening. Based on these data risk analysis calculations as well as developments of new screening strategies for low and high epidemic regions were performed. Method(s): From 2006 to 2010 approximately seven million blood donations were screened for HBsAG, MP-NAT (96 samples per pool) and anti-HBc. Blood donors, repeat reactive for anti-HBc, and negative for HBsAG and HBV MP-NAT, were screened in addition for anti-HBs and HBV ID-NAT. Re-entry of anti-HBc repeat reactive donors was allowed, if anti-HBs titer was higher than 100 IU/l and HBV ID-NAT was negative. Result(s): Prevalence of anti-HBc reactive donations was 2% for donors in North, Middle and South of Germany, respectively in 2006. Over the study period of 5 years, it was stable for first time donors but reduced for repeat donors to 0.2%. In total 16 lock-back examinations of repeat donors positive for HBV DNA and anti-HBc were investigated. Only one recipient out of 16 was anti-HBc reactive. The transfusion transmitted infectious pathway was not confirmed, because the recipient was HBV DNA negative. In a case/control study 118 recipients transfused with anti-HBc confirmed reactive blood components (anti-HBc and anti-HBe reactive components) were compared with 120 recipients transfused with anti-HBc negative blood components. The percentage of anti-HBc reactivity in both recipients groups were not significant different. Conclusion(s): The introduction of anti-HBc into blood donor screening was able to improve blood safety regarding to low viremic occult hepatitis B infected blood donors. No hepatitis B transfusion transmitted infections were observed after introduction of anti-HBc into blood donor screening in 2006. Donor re-entry with anti-HBs antibodies (titer higher than 100 IU/l) is a safe procedure. Nevertheless based on our data, the most important test for donor re-entry is HBV ID-NAT for anti-HBc repeat reactive donations. Therefore we conclude that regions with low epidemic HBV prevalence can improve blood safety by introduction of anti-HBc blood donor screening in addition with a re-entry procedure, if HBV ID-NAT is negative and anti-HBs is reactive with a titer higher than 100 IU/l. In HBV high epidemic regions, anti-HBc blood donor screening can be introduced with a re-entry strategy of all blood donations that are negative by HBV ID-NAT. This modified screening strategy, enables a detection of infectious occult hepatitis B donations without loosing a high number of non infectious anti-HBc only reactive blood donors.

N2  - Background: There is increasing concern that emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) may be effectively transmitted by blood transfusion in addition to their common routes of infection. In most countries a range of safety measures are in place to minimize the transfusion transmission (TT) risk of well known infectious diseases, yet these might be insufficient against EIDs. Aim(s): In order to evaluate the potential threat of EIDs in EU countries a risk prioritization (RP) tool was developed to identify EIDs that are considered to be a high priority for blood safety. Method(s): Published literature was searched using Pubmed and Google Scholar with keywords: emerging infections, Europe, transmission by transfusion, blood safety, screening, tests, and risk model. In addition, information presented by experts on conferences and fact sheets published on public health and transfusion related websites were reviewed. Information on seventy EIDs was collected and assessed. We defined eight dimensions that characterize the risk of TT namely the likelihood of TT, the associated mortality rate, the severity and curability of the disease in recipients, the existence of specific screening questions, the availability of a test, the presence and duration of the agent in the blood, and the efficacy of pathogen removal. Each dimension is weighted and scored and the total score per disease is then obtained by summation of these scores. The tool was tested for thirty different outbreak scenarios and weighting schemes. Result(s): The 15% highest scoring diseases were classified as "high priority". Eight of these high priority diseases were relatively insensitive to the specific scenarios applied. These are: vCJD, HIV variants, Hepatitis E, Q fever, Yersiniosis, Babesiosis, Human African trypanosomiasis and WNV infection. Conclusion(s): The RP tool allows tailored ranking of TT risks of EIDs and can aid decision makers in anticipating the adequacy of safety measures taken.

N2  - BACKGROUND&AIMS: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) is the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in healthcare settings and accounts for 20-30 % of antibiotic associated diarrhea. Due to their proven efficacy and documented safety the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has increased tremendously over the last decade. Given the rising incidence of CDAD, concerns have been raised about the association of acid suppression and CDAD. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the potential association between PPIs and CDAD. METHOD(S): A search for controlled studies was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE using keywords and medical subject heading (MeSH) terms for PPIs and CDAD. Screening of titles and abstracts was followed by full text screening. We included all controlled trials examining the association between PPIs and CDAD. Data were extracted for the study population, details about PPI use and incidence of CDAD. Meta-analysis was performed using the random effect model. Q and I2 statistics were used to examine heterogeneity. Additionally, we used the Bradford Hill criteria to determine if the association was causal. RESULT(S): Our literature search yielded a total of 620 articles and 26 articles were finally included for data extraction, of which 22 were used for the meta-analysis. We found a statistical significant association between PPI use and CDAD (pooled odds ratio 2.04; 95 % confidence interval 1.93-2.17). The Q and I2 statistics indicated significant heterogeneity. This association was also causal as it fulfilled all the criteria proposed by Bradford Hill. CONCLUSION(S): The current state of evidence suggests an association and potentially causal link between PPI use and CDAD. While PPI use, like antibiotic will remain an integral part of inpatient management, judicious use and even strict guidelines may be necessary to curb the epidemic of CDAD. (Table presented).

N2  - Introduction: Since 1985, AIDS cases diagnosed in health facilities throughout Tuscany are compulsorily reported to the regional AIDS registry. Today the surveillance of AIDS cases essentially gives indications on the accessibility and effectiveness of secondary prevention services but it is rather inadequate for monitoring the epidemic of acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. So, it is necessary to implement systems for monitoring HIV infection in order to identify new groups with the highest personal and behavioural risk and steer the activities of prevention. The Italian Ministry of Health-Decree of March 31 2008-has promoted the activation of the monitoring system of new diagnoses of HIV infection in Italy. The surveillance system of HIV diagnoses in Tuscany started in May 2011 and it is currently being implemented. Objective(s): The surveillance system of HIV infection has the following objectives: (1) to define the incidence of newly diagnosed HIV cases; (2) to estimate the prevalence of HIV infection; (3) to provide useful data for defining the demand for health services for the care of people with HIV; (4) to determine risk factors for progression of HIV infection to AIDS; (5) to plan and evaluate preventive measures. Method(s): Regional surveillance for newly diagnosed HIV infection was based on cases of infection reported by structures enabled (infectious diseases units and sexually transmitted diseases unit) by the regional HIV surveillance center (Unit of Epidemiology, Regional Health Agency of Tuscany) on the first occasion of diagnosis in Tuscany. Data are collected by filling out a special regional notification form, and the regional HIV surveillance center provides for the computerization of forms received from the reporting units in a data base. Result(s): Preliminary data on the diagnosis of HIV infection in Tuscany will be available in the first half of 2011. However, there are currently some information on the HIV-positive individuals in care at the units of infectious diseases for the period January-September 2008. During this period, 4,457 HIV-positive patients were followed by the infectious diseases unit. Of these cases, 24.2% was female and most of patients aged between 35 and 59 years at diagnosis (61.6%). Women were younger than males: 33.4% aged between 17 and 34 years compared to 25.9% of males. Exposure to HIV for the majority (70%) of patients was sexual contact: 26.8% homosexual contact and 43.2% heterosexual contact. Of the 4,457 HIV-positive patients 14.8% (658 patients) were diagnosed with AIDS, while for the 183 subjects this information is not known. With regard to HIVpositive patients not yet on AIDS (3,616), most of them (90.4%) had a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count greater than or equal to 200. Conclusion(s): The monitoring system of new diagnoses of HIV infection is the best way to describe the changes of the epidemic and provide the tools needed to plan interventions for primary and secondary prevention.

N2  - Background: The household secondary attack proportion (SAP) is commonly used to measure the transmissibility of an infectious disease. Method(s): We analyzed the final outbreak size distributions of pandemic A(H1N1), seasonal A(H1N1), and A(H3N2) infections identified in paired sera collected from members of 117 Hong Kong households in April and in August-October 2009. Result(s): The estimated community probability of infection overall was higher for children than adults; the probability was similar for pandemic A(H1N1) and seasonal A(H3N2) influenza. The household SAP for pandemic A(H1N1) was higher in children than in adults, whereas for seasonal A(H3N2), it was similar in children and adults. The estimated SAPs were similar for seasonal A(H3N2) and pandemic A(H1N1) after excluding persons with higher baseline antibody titers from analysis. Conclusion(s): Pandemic and seasonal influenza A viruses had similar age-specific transmissibility in a cohort of initially uninfected households, after adjustment for baseline immunity. © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

T1  - A two-stage model for the SIR outbreak: Accounting for the discrete and stochastic nature of the epidemic at the initial contamination stage

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - The evolution of an infectious disease outbreak in an isolated population is split into two stages: a stochastic Markov process describing the initial contamination and a linked deterministic dynamical system with random initial conditions for the continued development of the outbreak. The initial contamination stage is well approximated by the randomized SI (susceptible/infected) model. We obtain the probability density function for the early behavior of the epidemic. This provides an appropriate distribution for the initial conditions with which to describe the subsequent deterministic evolution of the system. We apply the method of matching asymptotic expansions to link the two stages. This allows us to estimate the standard deviation of the number of infectives in the developed outbreak, and the statistical characteristics of the outbreak time. The potential trajectories caused by the stochastic nature of the contamination stage show greatest divergence at the initial and fade-out stages and coincide most tightly just after the peak of the epidemic. The time to the peak of the outbreak is not strongly dependent on the initial trajectory. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - The effect of neighbourhood definitions on spatio-temporal models of disease outbreaks: Separation distance versus range overlap

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - The definition of the spatial relatedness between infectious and susceptible animal groups is a fundamental component of spatio-temporal modelling of disease outbreaks. A common neighbourhood definition for disease spread in wild and feral animal populations is the distance between the centroids of neighbouring group home ranges. This distance can be used to define neighbourhood interactions, and also to describe the probability of successful disease transmission. Key limitations of this approach are (1) that a susceptible neighbour of an infectious group with an overlapping home range - but whose centroid lies outside the home range of an infectious group - will not be considered for disease transmission, and (2) the degree of overlap between the home ranges is not taken into account for those groups with centroids inside the infectious home range. We assessed the impact of both distance-based and range overlap methods of disease transmission on model-predicted disease spread. Range overlap was calculated using home ranges modelled as circles. We used the Sirca geographic automata model, with the population data from a nine-county study area in Texas that we have previously described. For each method we applied 100 model repetitions, each of 100 time steps, to 30 index locations. The results show that the rate of disease spread for the range-overlap method is clearly less than the distance-based method, with median outbreaks modelled using the latter being 1.4-1.45 times larger. However, the two methods show similar overall trends in the area infected, and the range-overlap median (48 and 120 for cattle and pigs, respectively) falls within the 5th-95th percentile range of the distance-based method (0-96 and 0-252 for cattle and pigs, respectively). These differences can be attributed to the calculation of the interaction probabilities in the two methods, with overlap weights generally resulting in lower interaction probabilities. The definition of spatial neighbourhood has important implications for models used in decision-support systems for disease preparedness and response. This research presents a first step towards more realistic representations that could be used in spatio-temporal models of disease outbreaks. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - From Asia, the novel (and old) fifth malaria Plasmodium of human beings
A1  - Sabbatani S.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - A novel form of human malaria Plasmodium knowlesi has been identified in small epidemic foci occurred during the last decade in Malaysia. Based on a review of the available literature data, the Authors underline the diagnostic importance of molecular biology examinations performed with primers which are specific of Plasmodium knowlesi, since the standard hemoscopy may fail in distinguishing Plasmodium knowlesi from Plasmodium malariae, due to their similar appearance. P. knowlesi has been reported as a causative parasite agent of life-threatening and even lethal forms of malaria. In humans, its clinical picture is more severe a compared to that of P. malariae, since the disease is characterized by a greater parasitemia, versus that is referred in the course of P. malariae disease. The most effective carrier of P. knowlesi is represented by the mosquito Anopheles leucosphyrus, which is attracted by both humans and monkeys. Among primates, the natural hosts of P. Knowlesi are known until now and have been represented by Macaca fascicularis and Macaca nemestina, while other monkeys including Saimiri scirea and Macaca mulatta, which cannot become infected. These might be useful in eventual experimental models. When facing the potentially severe evolution of human disease by P. knowlesi, we remark the key role played by a prompt disease recognition, which is expected to be more easy and obvious in patients followed in endemic countries at elevate risk, but should be carefully implemented for subjects coming back to health care services of western countries, presenting with a number of typical signs and symptoms of malaria, after travelling in South-East Asia where they were engaged in staying or making excursions in the tropical forest. In these last cases, both diagnosis and treatment should be prompt, timely, and appropriate. According to literature data, in non-severe human cases the old and trivial chloroquine remained very effective against P. knowlesi, achieving the disappearance of signs and symptoms in 96% of cases within the first day of pharmacological therapy. On the ground of the emerging epidemiological figures, P. knowlesi was added to Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium falciparum, as the fifth etiological agent of human malaria. During the next years, it will become mandatory to plan an adequate surveillance programme of the epidemiological evolution of this novel form of human malaria, paying also maximum attention to the clinical presentation of patients affected by P. knowlesi malaria, which are expected to suffer from a more severe clinical course, according to the time elapsed from the appearance of the early signs and symptoms. Some preliminary clinical figures suggest that a greater severity is related to an increased parasitemia, and parallels the increased interhuman infectious passages of parasites. © Sabbatani et al.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Nucleic acid testing has been routinely performed in all blood donations in France since July 1st 2001. This is the story of a controversial decision. "The unacceptable HIV risk" in the context of the early 2000s influenced the decision. The results achieved over these past 10. years are analyzed given the expected progress of this new screening tool for infectious agents in transfusion. They confirm the relevance of models used by experts in 2000. Out of 22.3 million donations over the period (2001-2009), 22 donations have been rejected because of nucleic acid testing positive for hepatitis C virus (n = 11) and human immunodeficiency virus (n = 11). Nucleic acid testing has contributed to improve the functioning of the transfusion chain activities in order to ensure the availability of blood products. In terms of reactivity against emerging infectious agents, its role in the West Nile virus (WNV) outbreak is exemplary, but it did not play a similar role in crises of the same order. ALT determination has been stopped thanks to nucleic acid testing. The risk of contamination of the method by amplification products has been confirmed and caution is still required. Nucleic acid testing is being maintained and reached a new milestone in 2010 with the implementation of a full automated system, meanwhile pool screening was given up and hepatitis B virus screening became widespread. Nucleic acid tests will probably be revised when all blood products are pathogen-inactivated. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

T1  - Contamination level and ingestion dose of foodborne pathogens associated with infections

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Intake of a small dose of foodborne pathogens can cause infection. In this study, an estimation of the infectious dose of the pathogens was obtained by conducting microbiological risk assessments. The contamination levels of foodborne pathogens were analysed in 17 outbreaks of Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Campylobacter jejuni occurring in Japan between 2004 and 2006. The infectious dose was estimated in 14 of the 17 outbreaks utilizing existing data. In three outbreaks of Salmonella infection in which the infection rate was 89-100%, the dose of the ingested pathogens was estimated to be 259 000-14 000 000 000 c.f.u. In other outbreaks of Salmonella infection, the infection rate and dose of the ingested pathogens were 10-66.4% and 81-1560 c.f.u. or most probable number (MPN), respectively. The ingested Salmonella dose is likely to be related to the infection rate; however, storage conditions should be taken into account when making this determination. In an outbreak of E. coli O157 infection, the infection rate and ingestion dose were 100% and 2 to <9 c.f.u., respectively, while in an outbreak of enterotoxigenic E. coli infection, they were 93% and 25-1000 c.f.u., respectively. Finally, in an outbreak of C. jejuni infection, the infection rate and ingestion dose were 37.5% and 360 MPN, respectively. These results will be particularly valuable for risk assessment. © Cambridge University Press 2010.

N2  - Background: The spatial modeling of infectious disease distributions and dynamics is increasingly being undertaken for health services planning and disease control monitoring, implementation, and evaluation. Where risks are heterogeneous in space or dependent on person-to-person transmission, spatial data on human population distributions are required to estimate infectious disease risks, burdens, and dynamics. Several different modeled human population distribution datasets are available and widely used, but the disparities among them and the implications for enumerating disease burdens and populations at risk have not been considered systematically. Here, we quantify some of these effects using global estimates of populations at risk (PAR) of P. falciparum malaria as an example. Method(s): The recent construction of a global map of P. falciparum malaria endemicity enabled the testing of different gridded population datasets for providing estimates of PAR by endemicity class. The estimated population numbers within each class were calculated for each country using four different global gridded human population datasets: GRUMP (~1 km spatial resolution), LandScan (~1 km), UNEP Global Population Databases (~5 km), and GPW3 (~5 km). More detailed assessments of PAR variation and accuracy were conducted for three African countries where census data were available at a higher administrative-unit level than used by any of the four gridded population datasets. Result(s): The estimates of PAR based on the datasets varied by more than 10 million people for some countries, even accounting for the fact that estimates of population totals made by different agencies are used to correct national totals in these datasets and can vary by more than 5% for many low-income countries. In many cases, these variations in PAR estimates comprised more than 10% of the total national population. The detailed country-level assessments suggested that none of the datasets was consistently more accurate than the others in estimating PAR. The sizes of such differences among modeled human populations were related to variations in the methods, input resolution, and date of the census data underlying each dataset. Data quality varied from country to country within the spatial population datasets. Conclusion(s): Detailed, highly spatially resolved human population data are an essential resource for planning health service delivery for disease control, for the spatial modeling of epidemics, and for decision-making processes related to public health. However, our results highlight that for the low-income regions of the world where disease burden is greatest, existing datasets display substantial variations in estimated population distributions, resulting in uncertainty in disease assessments that utilize them. Increased efforts are required to gather contemporary and spatially detailed demographic data to reduce this uncertainty, particularly in Africa, and to develop population distribution modeling methods that match the rigor, sophistication, and ability to handle uncertainty of contemporary disease mapping and spread modeling. In the meantime, studies that utilize a particular spatial population dataset need to acknowledge the uncertainties inherent within them and consider how the methods and data that comprise each will affect conclusions. © 2011 Tatem et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - The relationship between chemical exposure and disease outbreak in fish has not been fully defined due to the limitations of experimental systems (model fish and pathogens). Therefore, we constructed a system using the Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus, and viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), and evaluated it by heavy oil (HO) exposure. The fish were exposed to HO at 0.3, 0.03, 0.003, and 0g/L following VHSV infection at doses of 102.5 or 103.5 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID)50/fish. As a result, groups given the dual stressors showed more than 90% mortality. Although VHSV infection at 102.5 and 103.5 TCID50/fish without HO exposure also induced high mortality, at 68.8% and 81.3%, respectively, HO exposure induced faster and higher mortality in the virus carrier fish, indicating that chemical stressors raise the risk of disease outbreak in fish. The experimental system established in this study could be useful for chemical risk assessment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Models cannot predict future outbreaks: A/H1N1 virus, the paradigm

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Evolution of the industrialized society had led to a risk management policy in many domains. Assessment of health care risk in the case of infectious diseases often includes mathematical models. Results of modelling were used in France to design emergency plans against flu pandemic. We believe that models cannot predict the features of the future outbreaks because the intrinsic properties of an emergent pathogen and the ecosystem in which it is developing are very complex. Of course, prediction of future outbreaks is not possible without using models, but we think that it is an illusion to presently believe that an emerging phenomenon can be anticipated by using only prediction from models. The recent pandemic caused by the novel A/H1N1 virus has confirmed the unpredictability of infectious diseases. The rapid evolution in several domains such as antimicrobial therapeutics, vaccine and hygiene conditions make comparison with past pandemics hard. The adherence of populations to prevention measures and immunisation campaigns are unpredictable. In addition, the presentation of pessimistic models is deleterious. They impress governments and provoke fears. There is a striking necessity to develop the number and the capacities of sentinel centres to take and adapt decisions based on timely available scientific information. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.

N2  - Background: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has a disproportionate burden of both infectious and chronic diseases compared with other world regions. Current disease estimates for SSA are based on sparse data, but projections indicate increases in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) caused by demographic and epidemiologic transitions. We review the literature on NCDs in SSA and summarize data from the World Health Organization and International Agency for Research on Cancer on the prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus Type 2, cancer and their risk factors. Method(s): We searched the PubMed database for studies on each condition, and included those that were community based, conducted in any SSA country and reported on disease or risk factor prevalence, incidence or mortality. Result(s): We found few community-based studies and some countries (such as South Africa) were over-represented. The prevalence of NCDs and risk factors varied considerably between countries, urban/ rural location and other sub-populations. The prevalence of stroke ranged from 0.07 to 0.3%, diabetes mellitus from 0 to 16%, hypertension from 6 to 48%, obesity from 0.4 to 43% and current smoking from 0.4 to 71%. Hypertension prevalence was consistently similar among men and women, whereas women were more frequently obese and men were more frequently current smokers. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of NCDs and their risk factors is high in some SSA settings. With the lack of vital statistics systems, epidemiologic studies with a variety of designs (cross-sectional, longitudinal and interventional) capable of in-depth analyses of risk factors could provide a better understanding of NCDs in SSA, and inform health-care policy to mitigate the oncoming NCD epidemic.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Infectious gastroenteritis is a common illness in Australia as elsewhere. Data from a year-long national gastroenteritis survey in 2001-2002 showed that gastroenteritis was more common in the northern and hotter part of Australia. These data were used to quantify associations between local weather variables and gastroenteritis in people aged >5 years while controlling for socioeconomic status. A distributed lag model was used to examine the influence of weather over a period of days prior to an event and the maximal effect was found at a lag of 2-5 days. The total effect over the preceding week indicated a relative increase from baseline in the probability of gastroenteritis of 2.48% (95% CI 1.01-3.97) for each degree rise (degreeC) over that period. Given the very high burden of gastroenteritis, this represents a substantial effect at the population level and has relevance for health predictions due to climate change.

N2  - Background. Sindbis virus (SINV) is an arthropod-borne alphavirus that causes rash and arthritis. In Finland, epidemics occur cyclically, but factors associated with clinical SINV infection are largely unknown. We conducted a population-based case-control study during the epidemic year 2002. Methods. SINV cases were serologically confirmed and reported to the National Infectious Disease Registry. Five control subjects, matched for age, sex, and residence, were selected from the National Population Information System. Data were collected using a self-administered mail survey. Conditional logistic regression models were used to identify independent risk factors; missing data were addressed using Bayesian full-likelihood modeling. Results. A total of 337 case patients (58% female; age range, 1-94 y) and 934 control subjects were enrolled. Reported exposure to mosquito bites (matched odds ratio [mOR], 16.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.1-33.4) and spending time in woods or marshland (mOR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.5) were independently associated with SINV infection in the multivariable model. The population-attributable risk for mosquito bites was 87.2%. There were dose-response relations for increased number of insect bites (mOR, 23.8-72.5) and increased time spent in woods or marshland (mOR, 1.3-2.2). Conclusions. Educating the public in endemic areas to avoid mosquito exposure and use protective measures remain important prevention measures for SINV infection. © The Author 2011.

T1  - Vaccines against viral hemorrhagic fevers: Non-human primate models
A1  - Carrion R.
A1  - Patterson J.L. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Viral hemorrhagic fevers are a group of disease syndromes caused by infection with certain RNA viruses. The disease is marked by a febrile response, malaise, coagulopathy and vascular permeability culminating in death. Case fatality rates can reach 90% depending on the etiologic agent. Currently, there is no approved antiviral treatment. Because of the high case fatality, risk of importation and the potential to use these agents as biological weapons, development of countermeasures to these agents is a high priority. The sporadic nature of disease outbreaks and the ethical issues associated with conducting a human trial for such diseases make human studies impractical; therefore, development of countermeasures must occur in relevant animal models. Non-human primates are superior models to study infectious disease because their immune system is similar to humans and they are good predictors of efficacy in vaccine development and other intervention strategies. This review article summarizes viral hemorrhagic fever non-human primate models. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.

T1  - Simulating and analysing infectious disease data in a heterogeneous population with migration
A1  - Wolkewitz M.
A1  - Schumacher M. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases has gained growing attention in epidemiology during the last decades. The major benefits of simulating compartmental models are the prediction of the consequences of potential interventions, a deeper understanding of epidemic dynamics and clinical decision support. The main limitation is however that several parameters are based on uncertain expert guesses (default values) and are not estimated from the study data. In this paper we build a bridge between an extension of the well-known deterministic S-I-R (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed) model which can be described with differential equations and the stochastic counterpart which can be used for statistical inference if outbreak data on an individual level are available. The possibly time-dependent transmission rate as well as the (basic) reproduction number are the main epidemiological parameters of interest. Furthermore, one important type of heterogeneity is considered: individuals may vary due to their susceptibility, i.e., risk factors for infection may be investigated. A SAS computer program is provided to simulate outbreak data for this type of setting. The statistical analysis and typical challenges with epidemic data are discussed. Given data on an individual level, the Cox-Aalen survival model that is based on a multiplicative-additive hazard structure turned out to be a suitable tool for that purpose. The results give valuable information for epidemiologists, statisticians and public health researchers. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

T1  - Chronic noncommunicable diseases and HIV-AIDS on a collision course: Relevance for health care delivery, particularly in low-resource settings - Insights from South Africa

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing a multiple disease burden. Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are emerging, and their risk factors are becoming more common as lifestyles change and rates of urbanization increase. Simultaneously, epidemics of infectious diseases persist, and HIV/AIDS has taken hold in the region, although recent data indicate a decrease in new HIV infection rates. With the use of diabetes as a marker for NCDs, it was estimated that the number of people with diabetes would rise between 2000 and 2010 despite the HIV/AIDS epidemic, largely because of the aging of the population and the increase in risk factors for diabetes in South Africa. These numbers are likely to increase further, given the declining HIV/AIDS mortality rates and longer life expectancy due to the up-scaling of antiretroviral therapy (ART), with its concomitant metabolic complications. Given that treated HIV/AIDS has become a chronic disease, and the health care needs of people on ART resemble those of people with NCDs, and given that vertical programs are difficult to sustain when health systems are underresourced and strained, there is a powerful argument to integrate the primary level care for people with chronic diseases, whether they be NCDs or infectious diseases. Pilot studies are required to test the feasibility of an integrated service that extends from health facilities into the community in a reciprocal manner based on the WHO Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions model of care. These will begin to provide the evidence that policy makers need to change the mode of health care delivery. © 2011 American Society for Nutrition.

N2  - Background. On 12 February 2008, an infected Swiss traveler visited hospital A in Tucson, Arizona, and initiated a predominantly health care-associated measles outbreak involving 14 cases. We investigated risk factors that might have contributed to health care-associated transmission and assessed outbreak-associated hospital costs. Methods. Epidemiologic data were obtained by case interviews and review of medical records. Health care personnel (HCP) immunization records were reviewed to identify non-measles-immune HCP. Outbreakassociated costs were estimated from 2 hospitals. Results. Of 14 patients with confirmed cases, 7 (50%) were aged >=18 years, 4 (29%) were hospitalized, 7 (50%) acquired measles in health care settings, and all (100%) were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. Of the 11 patients (79%) who had accessed health care services while infectious, 1 (9%) was masked and isolated promptly after rash onset. HCP measles immunity data from 2 hospitals confirmed that 1776 (25%) of 7195 HCP lacked evidence of measles immunity. Among these HCPs, 139 (9%) of 1583 tested seronegative for measles immunoglobulin G, including 1 person who acquired measles. The 2 hospitals spent US$799,136 responding to and containing 7 cases in these facilities. Conclusions. Suspecting measles as a diagnosis, instituting immediate airborne isolation, and ensuring rapidly retrievable measles immunity records for HCPs are paramount in preventing health care-associated spread and in minimizing hospital outbreak-response costs.

We developed a new extended epidemic model that incorporates of disease-related complications. This model was applied to empirical data on influenza during the epidemic season of 2001-2002 in Taipei County, Taiwan, to estimate the transmission parameters that were converted to the basic reproductive rate (R0). The proposed model, in conjunction with estimated parameters, was applied in quantifying the efficacy of different preventive strategies. results. During the study period there were 5 outbreaks of influenza. The estimated transmission probability for outbreak 1 was 0.135, with corresponding estimate of R0, 2.7; for outbreak 2, 0.165, with estimated R0, 3.3; for outbreak 3, 0.15, with R0, 4.5; for outbreak 4, 0.165, with R0, 5; and for outbreak 5, 0.165, with R0, 5.

T1  - Vaccination strategies for epidemic cholera in Haiti with implications for the developing world

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - In October 2010, a virulent South Asian strain of El Tor cholera began to spread in Haiti. Interventions have included treatment of cases and improved sanitation. Use of cholera vaccines would likely have further reduced morbidity and mortality, but such vaccines are in short supply and little is known about effective vaccination strategies for epidemic cholera. We use a mathematical cholera transmission model to assess different vaccination strategies.With limited vaccine quantities, concentrating vaccine in high-risk areas is always most efficient. We show that targeting one million doses of vaccine to areas with high exposure to Vibrio cholerae, enough for two doses for 5% of the population, would reduce the number of cases by 11%. The same strategy with enough vaccine for 30% of the population with modest hygienic improvement could reduce cases by 55% and save 3,320 lives. For epidemic cholera, we recommend a large mobile stockpile of enough vaccine to cover 30% of a country's population to be reactively targeted to populations at high risk of exposure.

N2  - Objective: The focus of this study was to ascertain the factors associated with 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 (pH1N1) infection during different phases of the epidemic. Method(s): In central Taiwan, 306 persons from households with schoolchildren were followed sequentially and serum samples were taken at three sampling time-points starting in the fall of 2008, shortly after influenza vaccination. Participants who seroconverted between two consecutive blood samplings were considered as having serological evidence of infection. A generalized estimation equation (GEE) with a logistic link to account for household correlations was applied to identify factors associated with pH1N1 infections during the pre-epidemic (April-June) and epidemic (September-October) periods. Result(s): The results showed that receiving an inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (ISIV) and having a hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI) titer of 40 or higher resulted in a significantly lower likelihood of pH1N1 infection during the pre-epidemic period only, for both children and adults (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.9). Having a previous infection by pH1N1 with a baseline titer of 20 or higher resulted in a significantly lower likelihood of infection by pH1N1 during the epidemic period (adjusted OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.02-0.16). Conclusion(s): Our results provide the first serological evidence to suggest a protection effect from receiving an ISIV against pH1N1 infection only when the HI titer reaches 40 or higher during the pre-epidemic period. This study gives an important insight into the control and intervention measures required for preventing infections during future influenza epidemics. © 2011 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Mathematical models have facilitated our understanding of infectious diseases dynamics and proved useful tools to compare control scenarios when interventional studies are not feasible or ethical. Here, we summarize evidence linking social, economic and biologic determinants to tuberculosis (TB) and review modeling approaches that have been used to understand their contribution to the epidemic dynamics of TB. Specifically, we find evidence for associations between smoking, indoor air pollution, diabetes mellitus, alcohol, nutritional status, crowding, migration, aging and economic trends, and the occurrence of TB infection and/or disease. We outline some methodological problems inherent to the study of these associations; these include study design issues, reverse causality and misclassification of both exposure and outcomes. We then go on to review two existing approaches to modeling the impact of determinants and the effect of interventions: the population attributable fraction model, which estimates the proportion of the TB burden that would be averted if exposure to a risk factor were eliminated from the population, and deterministic epidemic models that capture transmission dynamics and the indirect effects of interventions. We conclude by defining research priorities in both the study of specific determinants and the development of appropriate models to assess the impact of addressing these determinants. © 2011 The Union.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Most household models of disease transmission assume static household distributions. Although this is a reasonable simplification for assessing vaccination strategies at a single point in time or over the course of an outbreak, it has considerable drawbacks for assessing long term vaccination policies or for predicting future changes in immunity. We demonstrate that household models that include births, deaths and movement between households can show dramatically different patterns of infection and immunity to static population models. When immunity is assumed to be life-long, the pattern of births by household size is the key driver of infection, suggesting that the influx of susceptibles has most impact on infection risk in the household. In a comparison of 12 countries, we show that both the crude birth rate and the mean household size affect the risk of infection in households. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Antiretroviral treatment as prevention: Impact of the 'test and treat' strategy on the tuberculosis epidemic
A1  - Wood R.
A1  - Lawn S.D. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been remarkably effective in ameliorating Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-associated morbidity and mortality. The rapid decline in viral load during ART also presents an opportunity to develop a "treatment as prevention" strategy in order to reduce HIV transmission at a population level. Modelling exercises have demonstrated that for this strategy to be effective, early initiation of ART with high coverage of the HIV-infected population will be required. The HIV epidemic has fueled a resurgence of tuberculosis (TB) particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and widespread early initiation of ART could also impact this epidemic via several mechanisms. The proportion of patients with low CD4 cell counts who are at high risk of TB disease from progression of both latent and new TB infection would be greatly reduced. Entry into a life-long ART program provides an ongoing opportunity for intensified TB case finding among the HIV-infected population. Regular screening for HIV infection also presents an opportunity for intensified TB case finding in the general population. The combined effect of reduced progression of infection to disease and intensified case finding could reduce the overall prevalence of infectious TB, thereby further decreasing TB transmission. In addition, decreasing prevalence of HIV infection would reduce the TB-susceptible pool within the population. The 'test and treat' strategy therefore has potential to reduce the TB risk at both an individual and a population level. In this paper we explore the expected "TB dividend" of wider access to ART and also explore the potential of the "test and treat" strategy to impact on TB transmission, particularly in the heavily burdened setting of sub- Saharan Africa. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  - Background: There were large outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease in both 2008 and 2009 in China. Method(s): Using the national surveillance data since 2 May 2008, we summarized the epidemiologic characteristics of the recent outbreaks. Using a susceptible-infectious-recovered transmission model, we evaluated the transmissibility of the disease and potential risk factors. Result(s): Children ages 1.0 to 2.9 years were the most susceptible to hand, foot, and mouth disease (odds ratios [OR] >2.3 as compared with other age-groups). Infant cases had the highest incidences of severe disease (ORs >1.4) and death (ORs >2.4), as well as the longest delay from symptom onset to diagnosis (2.3 days). Boys were more susceptible than girls (OR = 1.56 [95% confidence interval = 1.56-1.57]). A 1-day delay in diagnosis was associated with increases in the odds of severe disease by 40% (39%-42%) and in the odds of death by 54% (44%-65%). Compared with Coxsackie A16, enterovirus 71 is more strongly associated with severe disease (OR = 16 [13-18]) and death (OR = 40 [13-127]). The estimated local effective reproductive numbers among prefectures ranged from 1.4 to 1.6 (median = 1.4) in spring and stayed below 1.2 in other seasons. A higher risk of transmission was associated with temperatures in the range of 70degree F to 80degreeF, higher relative humidity, lower wind speed, more precipitation, greater population density, and 16 [13-18] periods during which schools were open. Conclusion(s): Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a moderately transmittable infectious disease, mainly among preschool children. Enterovirus 71 was responsible for most severe cases and fatalities. Mixing of asymptomatically infected children in schools might have contributed to spread the of infection. Timely diagnosis may be 40 [31-127] key to reducing the high mortality rate in infants. © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - To characterize an outbreak of pandemic H1N1 2009 among healthcare personnel (HCP), we conducted a cross-sectional survey of HCP who had worked in four general hospitals during the outbreak. More than one-quarter of responding HCP (27.6%) had influenza-like illness (ILI) during the outbreak. The estimated infection rate of pandemic H1N1 2009 was 9.1% in the study of HCP. Independent risk factors for ILI were female gender, <40 years of age, the presence of chronic diseases associated with influenza complications, having family members with ILI or pandemic H1N1 2009, and working in influenza outpatient, influenza inpatient, non-influenza outpatient or emergency departments. During the outbreak of pandemic H1N1 2009, HCP frequently had ILI or the influenza infection. The development of the influenza infection in HCP was associated with some of their baseline characteristics, occupational risk factors, and non-occupational ones during the outbreak. © 2011 The British Infection Association.

N2  - In this present work, the characteristics of hazardous gas dispersion and possible cross-unit contamination around a complex-shaped high-rise residential building due to wind effect are thoroughly studied using physical modeling method. Experiments were performed in a boundary layer wind tunnel for a 1:30 scale model that represented a 10-story residential building in prototype. Tracer gas, simulating exhausted room air, was continuously released from different floor levels, and its concentrations on the adjacent envelope surfaces were measured using fast flame ionization detectors. The mean concentration fields were reported and analyzed under different configurations during the experiment to consider the effects on pollutant dispersion behavior due to changes in source position and approaching wind condition, with the main emphasis on the differences between open-window and closed-window conditions. In particular, the measured concentration fields were further examined from a practical point of view, with respect to hazard assessment. Understanding these hazardous plume dispersion features is useful for employing effective intervention strategies in modern residential building environment in case of hazardous substance release. The study on this physical process is not only helpful to reduce the hazardous effect of routine release of harmful pollutant near the building, but also useful for the purpose of prevention and control of accidental infectious diseases outbreak. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Protection against foodborne diseases
T3  - La protezione dalle malattie trasmesse tramite alimenti

N2  - Food-borne diseases are the most frequent infectious diseases affecting travelers. This paper focuses on some aspects of the prevention of such infections, which may be important in travel medicine professionals' daily practice. Travelers' diarrhea is the most frequent infectious disease in travelers: its prevention based on food selection, hygiene measures and probiotics use has a limited value, and the continuous use of antibiotic prophylaxis is not appreciated by travelers. Some vaccines have been developed, and some are in the pipeline; in spite of being only partially protective, they have shown a favorable cost/benefit ratio. Cholera is an epidemic disease, with outbreaks scattered in the world but related among them (7th pandemic); immunization is recommended during outbreaks, or in prolonged stays in risk areas. Hepatitis A has a global distribution, and recommendations for immunization depend on the seroprevalence in the population; this is about 5% in the Italian population, but over 80% in immigrants to Italy: in the latter a serologic screening should be done before immunizing. In mathematical models, the duration of protection has shown to last more than 20 years, and underlying immune memory provides protection far beyond the duration of anti-HAV antibodies. Typhoid fever is frequent in Africa and in the Indian Subcontinent; the live oral Ty21a vaccine is protective against both S. typhi and S. paratyphi; the parenteral Vi polysaccharide vaccine has a greater protection rate, but only against S. typhi.

N2  - The control of highly infectious diseases of livestock such as classical swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease, and avian influenza is fraught with ethical, economic, and public health dilemmas. Attempts to control outbreaks of these pathogens rely on massive culling of infected farms, and farms deemed to be at risk of infection. Conventional approaches usually involve the preventive culling of all farms within a certain radius of an infected farm. Here we propose a novel culling strategy that is based on the idea that farms that have the highest expected number of secondary infections should be culled first. We show that, in comparison with conventional approaches (ring culling), our new method of risk based culling can reduce the total number of farms that need to be culled, the number of culled infected farms (and thus the expected number of human infections in case of a zoonosis), and the duration of the epidemic. Our novel risk based culling strategy requires three pieces of information, viz. the location of all farms in the area at risk, the moments when infected farms are detected, and an estimate of the distance-dependent probability of transmission.

N2  - Contact networks are playing an increasingly important role in the study of epidemiology. Most of the existing work in this area has focused on considering the effect of underlying network structure on epidemic dynamics by using tools from probability theory and computer simulation. This work has provided much insight on the role that heterogeneity in host contact patterns plays on infectious disease dynamics. Despite the important understanding afforded by the probability and simulation paradigm, this approach does not directly address important questions about the structure of contact networks such as what is the best network model for a particular mode of disease transmission, how parameter values of a given model should be estimated, or how precisely the data allow us to estimate these parameter values. We argue that these questions are best answered within a statistical framework and discuss the role of statistical inference in estimating contact networks from epidemiological data. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - This study, through a phylogenetic analysis, is aimed to identify potential epidemiological networks and sequence interrelationships between acute/early and chronic infections in both drug-naive and drug-experienced individuals within a local, well-defined setting and to investigate the population dynamics of transmitted resistance and the potential contribution of untreated patients to the spread of antiretroviral resistance. A total of 884 HIV-1 B subtype pol gene sequences from 306 drug-naive (40 recently and 266 chronically infected) and 578 drug-treated HIV-1 infected patients were collected through routine drug-resistance testing between 2000 and 2008 in a single center (Division of Infectious Disease, Bergamo, Northern Italy). Bayesian phylogenetic tree was reconstructed and transmission clusters were recognized using a posterior probability as statistical support of each cluster. Differences among clustered and non-clustered drug-resistance mutations were assessed by Fisher's exact test.In our cohort we identified five clusters including >=6 sequences with the root posterior probability of 100%. Dated phylogenies reconstructed through Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo model was possible for only two main clade (>=10 sequences) originated between 1990 and 2002.Among the 306 drug-naive individuals, 12% carried a viral strain with at least 1 major mutation associated with transmitted drug resistance and 36% of these strains were involved in significant clusters.We report for the first time that many (34%) of HIV-1 subtype B transmission clusters indentified in Italy were only composed by drug-naive individuals and that the 14% of transmitted drug resistance was linked to transmission clusters composed only of newly diagnosed individuals. The phylogenetic analysis was performed on a large cohort of drug-naive recently/chronically infected individuals where drug-experienced patients represent almost all infected individuals in a restricted geographical area.Our findings highlight the role of newly diagnosed individuals, not yet exposed to antiretroviral drugs, in the transmission of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains, providing new insights for the planning and management of treatment programs in developing countries. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Evaluating the impact of different social networks on the spread of respiratory diseases has been limited by a lack of detailed data on transmission outside the household setting as well as appropriate statistical methods. Here, from data collected during a H1N1 pandemic (pdm) influenza outbreak that started in an elementary school and spread in a semirural community in Pennsylvania, we quantify how transmission of influenza is affected by social networks. We set up a transmission model for which parameters are estimated from the data via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Sitting next to a case or being the playmate of a case did not significantly increase the risk of infection; but the structuring of the school into classes and grades strongly affected spread. There was evidence that boys were more likely to transmit influenza to other boys than to girls (and vice versa), which mimicked the observed assortative mixing among playmates. We also investigated the presence of abnormally high transmission occurring on specific days of the outbreak. Late closure of the school (i.e., when 27% of students already had symptoms) had no significant impact on spread. School-aged individuals (6-18 y) facilitated the introduction and spread of influenza in households, but only about one in five cases aged >18 y was infected by a school-aged household member. This analysis shows the extent to which clearly defined social networks affect influenza transmission, revealing strong between-place interactions with back-and-forth waves of transmission between the school, the community, and the household.

N2  - The resurgence of infectious diseases of zoonotic origin observed in recent years imposes a major morbidity/mortality burden worldwide, and also a major economic burden that extends beyond pure medical costs. The resurgence and epidemiology of zoonoses are complex and dynamic, being influenced by varying parameters that can roughly be categorized as human-related, pathogen-related, and climate/environment-related; however, there is significant interplay between these factors. Human-related factors include modern life trends such as ecotourism, increased exposure through hunting or pet owning, and culinary habits, industrialization sequelae such as farming/food chain intensification, globalization of trade, human intrusion into ecosystems and urbanization, significant alterations in political regimes, conflict with accompanying breakdown of public health and surveillance infrastructure, voluntary or involuntary immigration, loosening of border controls, and hierarchy issues in related decision-making, and scientific advances that allow easier detection of zoonotic infections and evolution of novel susceptible immunocompromised populations. Pathogen-related factors include alterations in ecosystems and biodiversity that influence local fauna synthesis, favouring expansion of disease hosts or vectors, pressure for virulence/resistance selection, and genomic variability. Climate/environment-related factors, either localized or extended, such as El Nino southern oscillation or global warming, may affect host-vector life cycles through varying mechanisms. Emerging issues needing clarification include the development of predictive models for the infectious disease impact of environmental projects, awareness of the risk imposed on immunocompromised populations, recognition of the chronicity burden for certain zoonoses, and the development of different evaluations of the overall stress imposed by a zoonotic infection on a household, and not strictly a person. © 2011 The Authors.

N2  - Analysis of historical data has strongly shaped our understanding of the epidemiology of pandemic influenza and informs analysis of current and future epidemics. Here, the authors analyzed previously unpublished documents from a large household survey of the "Spanish" H1N1 influenza pandemic, conducted in 1918, for the first time quantifying influenza transmissibility at the person-to-person level during that most lethal of pandemics. The authors estimated a low probability of person-to-person transmission relative to comparable estimates from seasonal influenza and other directly transmitted infections but similar to recent estimates from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The authors estimated a very low probability of asymptomatic infection, a previously unknown parameter for this pandemic, consistent with an unusually virulent virus. The authors estimated a high frequency of prior immunity that they attributed to a largely unreported influenza epidemic in the spring of 1918 (or perhaps to cross-reactive immunity). Extrapolating from this finding, the authors hypothesize that prior immunity partially protected some populations from the worst of the fall pandemic and helps explain differences in attack rates between populations. Together, these analyses demonstrate that the 1918 influenza virus, though highly virulent, was only moderately transmissible and thus in a modern context would be considered controllable. © 2011 The Author.

N2  - Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) is an important infectious disease in Atlantic salmon farming causing recurrent epidemic outbreaks worldwide. The focus of this paper is on tracing the spread of ISA among Norwegian salmon farms. To trace transmission pathways for the ISA virus (ISAV), we use phylogenetic relationships between virus isolates in combination with space-time data on disease occurrences. The rate of ISA infection of salmon farms is modelled stochastically, where seaway distances between farms and genetic distances between ISAV isolates from infected farms play prominent roles. The model was fitted to data covering all cohorts of farmed salmon and the history of all farms with ISA between 2003 and summer 2009. Both seaway and genetic distances were significantly associated with the rate of ISAinfection.The fittedmodel predicts that the risk of infection from a neighbourhood infectious farm decreases with increasing seaway distance between the two farms. Furthermore, for a given infected farm with a given ISAV genotype, the source of infection is significantlymore likely to be ISAVof a small genetic distance than of moderate or large genetic distances. Nearly half of the farms with ISA in the investigated period are predicted to have been infected by an infectious farm in their neighbourhood, whereas the remaining half of the infected farms had unknown sources. For many of the neighbourhood infected farms, it was possible to point out one or a few infectious farms as the most probable sources of infection. This makes it possible to map probable infection pathways. © 2011 The Royal Society.

N2  - Introduction: Despite considerable research efforts, the epidemiological characteristics of post-infectious symptoms of the irritable bowel syndrome-type (PI-IBS) are not yet well defined. Estimates of its incidence after gastrointestinal (GI) infection show considerable variation and the number of patients with a history of a GI infection among all patients with IBS is practically unknown. This review aims at summarizing published estimates (i) on the prevalence of PI-IBS among all IBS patients and (ii) on PI-IBS incidence after GI infection, critically discusses methodological differences that may explain the variation of the presented findings and gives an overview on currently identified risk factors for the development of PI-IBS. Method(s): A systematic literature review was perfomed of studies indexed in PUBMED that assessed the epidemiology and risk factors of PI-IBS. Result(s): The reported incidence of PI-IBS ranges for epidemic infections between 7 and 36 %, for individual infections between 4 and 36 % and for travellers diarrhea from 4 to 14 %. Estimates of the prevalence of PI-IBS range from as low as 7 % to more than of all IBS patients, depending on the study design. The predictors and biomarkers are varying among the studies. Conclusion(s): PI-IBS appears to be common following infectious enteritis and among all IBS patients, but precise estimates are still lacking. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.

N2  - Background. Salmonella serotype Tennessee is a rare cause of the estimated 1 million cases of salmonellosis occurring annually in the United States. In January 2007, we began investigating a nationwide increase in Salmonella Tennessee infections. Methods. We defined a case as Salmonella Tennessee infection in a patient whose isolate demonstrated 1 of 3 closely related pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns and whose illness began during the period 1 August 2006 through 31 July 2007.We conducted a case-control study in 22 states and performed laboratory testing of foods and environmental samples. Results. We identified 715 cases in 48 states; 37% of isolates were from urine specimens. Illness was associated with consuming peanut butter more than once a week (matched odds ratio [mOR], 3.5 [95% confidence interval {95% CI}, 1.4-9.9]), consuming Brand X peanut butter (mOR, 12.1 [95% CI, 3.6-66.3]), and consuming Brand Y peanut butter (mOR, 9.1 [95% CI, 1.0-433]). Brands X and Y were produced in 1 plant, which ceased production and recalled products on 14 February 2007. Laboratories isolated outbreak strains of Salmonella Tennessee from 34 Brands X and Y peanut butter jars and 2 plant environmental samples. Conclusions. This large, widespread outbreak of salmonellosis is the first linked to peanut butter in the United States; a nationwide recall resulted in outbreak control. Environmental contamination in the peanut butter plant likely caused this outbreak. This outbreak highlights the risk of salmonellosis from heat-processed foods of nonanimal origin previously felt to be low risk for Salmonella contamination. - The Author 2011.

N2  - Background: The person-to-person transmission of influenza-like illness (ILI) and influenza has been described mostly in long-term care units. Studies in acute hospital settings are rare and mostly retrospective. Method(s): We prospectively estimated the relative risk (RR) of hospital-acquired (HA) ILI during hospitalization according to in-hospital exposures to contagious individuals. Surveillance of ILI and laboratory-confirmed influenza was undertaken at Edouard Herriot Hospital (1100 beds) during 3 influenza seasons. A total of 21 519 patients and 2153 health care workers (HCWs) from 2004 to 2007 were included. The RR of HA-ILI in patients was calculated according to exposure to other contagious patients and HCWs. Result(s): For patients exposed to at least 1 contagious HCW compared with those with no documented exposure in the hospital, the RR of HA-ILI was 5.48 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09-14.37); for patients exposed to at least 1 contagious patient, the RR was 17.96 (95% CI, 10.07-32.03); and for patients exposed to at least 1 contagious patient and 1 contagious HCW, the RR was 34.75 (95% CI, 17.70-68.25). Conclusion(s): Hospitalized patients exposed to potentially infectious patients and HCWs with ILI inside the hospital are at greater risk for HA-ILI. Such results identify priorities regarding preventive measures for seasonal or pandemic influenza. ©2011 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

T1  - [Application of Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling in describing the brucellosis infections]

N2  - Based on the number of brucellosis cases reported from the national infectious diseases reporting system in Inner Mongolia from 2000 to 2007, a model was developed. Theories of spatial statistics were used, together with knowledge on infectious disease epidemiology and the frame of Bayesian statistics, before the Bayesian spatio-temporal models were respectively set. The effects of space, time, space-time and the relative covariates were also considered. These models were applied to analyze the brucellosis distribution and time trend in Inner Mongolia during 2000-2007. The results of Bayesian spatio-temporal models was expressed by mapping of the disease and compared to the conventional statistical methods. Results showed that the Bayesian models, under consideration of space-time effect and the relative covariates (deviance information criterion, DIC=2388.000), seemed to be the best way to serve the purpose. The county-level spatial correlation of brucellosis epidemics was positive and quite strong in Inner Mongolia. However, the spatial correlation varied with time and the coefficients ranged from 0.968 to 0.973, having a weakening trend during 2000-2007. Types of region and number of stock (cattle and sheep) might be related to the brucellosis epidemics, and the effect on the number of cattle and sheep changed by year. Compared to conventional statistical methods, Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling could precisely estimate the incidence relative risk and was an important tool to analyze the epidemic distribution patterns of infectious diseases and to estimate the incidence relative risk.

T1  - Infectious colitis

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Purpose of review The incidence of gastrointestinal infections continues to increase and infectious colitis contributes to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent advances in knowledge of pathogens causing infectious colitis. We describe the various pathogens and specifically focus on enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Entamoeba histolytica infections, and their impact on long-term effects, including postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. Recent findings Salmonella, Campylobacter, and EHEC outbreaks continue to occur with disturbing regularity. Peanut butter and peppers were recently responsible for outbreaks of nontyphoid Salmonella. Recent research has identified Salmonella genes required for colonization of various hosts and transposon-mediated differential hybridization was recently used to identify genes required during infection in different animal models. A number of other strains of EHEC in addition to O157:H7 are emerging as serious threats to food safety in the USA. Campylobacter jejuni isolates are of interest because of absence of genes encoding for classical enterotoxins, and lack of plasmids encoding genes promoting bacterial invasion. Recent research has identified that the organism is able to invade and replicate in infected epithelia via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-4. Also patients with infectious colitis, in particular Salmonella and Campylobacter, are at increased risk of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease on long-term follow-up. The paradigm of Entamoeba histolytica infection is changing with recent reports of detection of E. dispar deoxyribonucleic acid sequences, previously considered nonpathogenic. Summary There has been an explosion in the understanding of the epidemiology, pathobiology, and mechanisms underlying infectious colitis. Additional studies to address prevention strategies and strict screening modalities for these infections are necessary. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health  Lippincott Williams& Wilkins.

N2  - Assuming that no human had any previously acquired immunoprotection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during the 2003 SARS outbreak, the biological bases for possible difference in individual susceptibility are intriguing. However, this issue has never been fully elucidated. Based on the premise that SARS patients belonging to a given genotype group having a significantly higher SARS infection rate than others would imply that genotype group being more susceptible, we make use of a compartmental model describing disease transmission dynamics and clinical and gene data of 100 laboratory confirmed SARS patients from Chinese Han population in Taiwan to estimate the infection rates of distinct candidate genotype groups among these SARS-infected individuals. The results show that CXCL10(-938AA) is always protective whenever it appears, but appears rarely and only jointly with either Fgl2(+158T/*) or HO-1(-497A/*), while (Fgl2)(+158T/*) is associated with higher susceptibility unless combined with CXCL10/IP-10(-938AA), when jointly is associated with lower susceptibility. The novel modeling approach proposed, which does not require sizable case and control gene datasets, could have important future public health implications in swiftly identifying potential high-risk groups associated with being highly susceptible to a particular infectious disease. © Society for Mathematical Biology 2009.

T1  - Risk factors for the evolutionary emergence of pathogens
A1  - Alexander H.K.
A1  - Day T. 
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Recent outbreaks of novel infectious diseases (e.g. SARS, influenza H1N1) have highlighted the threat of cross-species pathogen transmission. When first introduced to a population, a pathogen is often poorly adapted to its new host and must evolve in order to escape extinction. Theoretical arguments and empirical studies have suggested various factors to explain why some pathogens emerge and others do not, including host contact structure, pathogen adaptive pathways and mutation rates. Using a multi-type branching process, we model the spread of an introduced pathogen evolving through several strains. Extending previous models, we use a network-based approach to separate host contact patterns from pathogen transmissibility. We also allow for arbitrary adaptive pathways. These generalizations lead to novel predictions regarding the impact of hypothesized risk factors. Pathogen fitness depends on the host population in which it circulates, and the 'riskiest' contact distribution and adaptive pathway depend on initial transmissibility. Emergence probability is sensitive to mutation probabilities and number of adaptive steps required, with the possibility of large adaptive steps (e.g. simultaneous point mutations or recombination) having a dramatic effect. In most situations, increasing overall mutation probability increases the risk of emergence; however, notable exceptions arise when deleterious mutations are available. © 2010 The Royal Society.

N2  - Background: Whether information sources influence health protective behaviours during influenza pandemics or other emerging infectious disease epidemics is uncertain. Methodology: Data from cross-sectional telephone interviews of 1,001 Hong Kong adults in June, 2009 were tested against theory and data-derived hypothesized associations between trust in (formal/informal) information, understanding, self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility and worry, and hand hygiene and social distancing using Structural Equation Modelling with multigroup comparisons. Principal Findings: Trust in formal (government/media) information about influenza was associated with greater reported understanding of A/H1N1 cause (beta = 0.36) and A/H1N1 prevention self-efficacy (beta = 0.25), which in turn were associated with more hand hygiene (beta = 0.19 and beta = 0.23, respectively). Trust in informal (interpersonal) information was negatively associated with perceived personal A/H1N1 susceptibility (beta =20.21), which was negatively associated with perceived self-efficacy (beta =20.42) but positively associated with influenza worry (beta = 0.44). Trust in informal information was positively associated with influenza worry (beta = 0.16) which was in turn associated with greater social distancing (beta = 0.36). Multigroup comparisons showed gender differences regarding paths from trust in formal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, trust in informal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, and understanding of A/H1N1 cause to perceived self-efficacy. Conclusions/Significance: Trust in government/media information was more strongly associated with greater self-efficacy and handwashing, whereas trust in informal information was strongly associated with perceived health threat and avoidance behaviour. Risk communication should consider the effect of gender differences. © 2010 Liao et al.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Ethnic minorities in Europe such as the Chinese may need a special strategy with regard to risk communication about emerging infectious diseases. To engage them in precautionary actions, it is important to know their information sources, knowledge, and health beliefs., PURPOSE: This study's purpose is to study the use of information sources, knowledge, and health beliefs related to SARS and avian flu of Chinese people in the UK and The Netherlands, and to make comparisons with the general population in these countries., METHOD: Results of a self-administered questionnaire among 300 British/Dutch Chinese were compared to data obtained from a computer-assisted phone survey among the general population (n = 800)., RESULTS: British/Dutch Chinese got most information about emerging diseases from family and friends, followed by Chinese media and British/Dutch TV. They had less confidence than general groups in their doctor, government agencies, and consumer/patient interest groups. Their knowledge of SARS was high. They had a lower perceived threat than general populations with regard to SARS and avian flu due to a lower perceived severity. They had higher self-efficacy beliefs regarding SARS and avian flu., CONCLUSION: In case of new outbreaks of SARS/avian flu in China, local authorities in the UK and The Netherlands can best reach Chinese people through informal networks and British/Dutch TV, while trying to improve confidence in information from the government. In communications, the severity of the disease rather than the susceptibility appears to need most attention.

T1  - Mathematical models for assessing the role of airflow on the risk of airborne infection in hospital wards
A1  - Noakes C.J.
A1  - Andrew Sleigh P. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Understanding the risk of airborne transmission can provide important information for designing safe healthcare environments with an appropriate level of environmental control for mitigating risks. The most common approach for assessing risk is to use the Wells-Riley equation to relate infectious cases to human and environmental parameters. While it is a simple model that can yield valuable information, the model used as in its original presentation has a number of limitations. This paper reviews recent developments addressing some of the limitations including coupling with epidemic models to evaluate the wider impact of control measures on disease progression, linking with zonal ventilation or computational fluid dynamics simulations to deal with imperfect mixing in real environments and recent work on dose-response modelling to simulate the interaction between pathogens and the host. A stochastic version of theWells-Riley model is presented that allows consideration of the effects of small populations relevant in healthcare settings and it is demonstrated how this can be linked to a simple zonal ventilation model to simulate the influence of proximity to an infector. The results show how neglecting the stochastic effects present in a real situation could underestimate the risk by 15 per cent or more and that the number and rate of new infections between connected spaces is strongly dependent on the airflow. Results also indicate the potential danger of using fully mixed models for future risk assessments, with quanta values derived from such cases less than half the actual source value. © 2009 The Royal Society.

N2  - We present a metapopulation model of the spread of equine influenza among thoroughbred horses parametrized with data from a 2003 outbreak in Newmarket, UK. The number of horses initially susceptible is derived from a threshold theorem and a published statistical model. Two simulated likelihood-based methods are used to find the within- and between-yard transmissions using both exponential and empirical latent and infectious periods. We demonstrate that the 2003 outbreak was largely locally driven and use the parametrized model to address important questions of control. The chance of a large epidemic is shown to be largely dependent on the size of the index yard. The impact of poor responders to vaccination is estimated under different scenarios. A small proportion of poor responders strongly influences the efficiency of vaccine policies, which increases risk further when the vaccine and infecting strains differ following antigenic drift. Finally, the use of vaccinating in the face of an outbreak is evaluated at a global and individual management group level. The benefits for an individual horse trainer are found to be substantial, although this is influenced by the behaviour of other trainers. © 2009 The Royal Society.

T1  - Spread of infectious disease through clustered populations
A1  - Miller J.C. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Networks of person-to-person contacts form the substrate along which infectious diseases spread. Most network-based studies of this spread focus on the impact of variations in degree (the number of contacts an individual has). However, other effects such as clustering, variations in infectiousness or susceptibility, or variations in closeness of contacts may play a significant role. We develop analytic techniques to predict how these effects alter the growth rate, probability and size of epidemics, and validate the predictions with a realistic social network. We find that (for a given degree distribution and average transmissibility) clustering is the dominant factor controlling the growth rate, heterogeneity in infectiousness is the dominant factor controlling the probability of an epidemic and heterogeneity in susceptibility is the dominant factor controlling the size of an epidemic. Edge weights (measuring closeness or duration of contacts) have impact only if correlations exist between different edges. Combined, these effects can play a minor role in reinforcing one another, with the impact of clustering the largest when the population is maximally heterogeneous or if the closer contacts are also strongly clustered. Our most significant contribution is a systematic way to address clustering in infectious disease models, and our results have a number of implications for the design of interventions. © 2009 The Royal Society.

T1  - The role of pre-emptive culling in the control of foot-and-mouth disease

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - The 2001 foot-and-mouth disease epidemic was controlled by culling of infectious premises and preemptive culling intended to limit the spread of disease. Of the control strategies adopted, routine culling of farms that were contiguous to infected premises caused the most controversy. Here we perform a retrospective analysis of the culling of contiguous premises as performed in 2001 and a simulation study of the effects of this policy on reducing the number of farms affected by disease. Our simulation results support previous studies and show that a national policy of contiguous premises (CPs) culling leads to fewer farms losing livestock. The optimal national policy for controlling the 2001 epidemic is found to be the targeting of all contiguous premises, whereas for localized outbreaks in high animal density regions, more extensive fixed radius ring culling is optimal. Analysis of the 2001 data suggests that the lowest-risk CPs were generally prioritized for culling, however, even in this case, the policy is predicted to be effective. A sensitivity analysis and the development of a spatially heterogeneous policy show that the optimal culling level depends upon the basic reproductive ratio of the infection and the width of the dispersal kernel. These analyses highlight an important and probably quite general result: optimal control is highly dependent upon the distance over which the pathogen can be transmitted, the transmission rate of infection and local demography where the disease is introduced. © 2009 The Royal Society.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Climate change is expected to manifest in the shift of organisms to regions where they were not present in the past, potentially entailing previously unseen biological risks. However, studies evaluating these future trends are scarce. Here, an important group of vectors (sandflies) and the pathogen transmitted (Leishmania infantum complex) causing the infectious disease visceral leishmaniasis is investigated, focussing on potential establishment in Germany during the 21st century. As the most important habitat factor, temperature requirements of pathogen and vector were derived from the literature and compared with recent climate records - provided by worldclim - and climate change scenarios. Climate data from the Regional Climate Model REMO were obtained and averaged over the time periods 2011- 2040, 2041-2070 and 2071-2100. Projected temperature changes (based on the A1B and A2 scenarios) were correlated with the constraints of vector and pathogen. Simulated potentially suitable habitat areas for vector and pathogen were merged to generate a temperature-derived risk map of visceral leishmaniasis. Temperature conditions seem to become suitable for the vector across large swaths of Germany. Nevertheless, temperature constraints for the pathogen may defer the establishment of the parasitic disease, particularly during the first half of the 21st century. Long-lasting epidemics of visceral leishmaniasis are therefore not expected in Germany during the next few decades, although during extremely warm years an increase in autochthonous cases of leishmaniasis may occur. The southwest (Upper Rhine Valley) and west (Cologne Bight) of Germany are identified as risk areas. The time of potential establishment and corresponding rise in biological risk varies between scenarios, due to differences in the predicted rate of temperature increase.

N2  - Understanding the conditions underlying the proliferation of infectious diseases is crucial for mitigating future outbreaks. Since its arrival in North America in 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) has led to population-wide declines of bird species, morbidity and mortality of humans, and expenditures of millions of dollars on treatment and control. To understand the environmental conditions that best explain and predict WNV prevalence, we employed recently developed spatial modeling techniques in a recognized WNV hotspot, Orange County, California. Our models explained 85-95% of the variation of WNV prevalence in mosquito vectors, and WNV presence in secondary human hosts. Prevalence in both vectors and humans was best explained by economic variables, specifically per capita income, and by anthropogenic characteristics of the environment, particularly human population and neglected swimming pool density. While previous studies have shown associations between anthropogenic change and pathogen presence, results show that poorer economic conditions may act as a direct surrogate for environmental characteristics related to WNV prevalence. Low-income areas may be associated with higher prevalence for a number of reasons, including variations in property upkeep, microhabitat conditions conducive to viral amplification in both vectors and hosts, host community composition, and human behavioral responses related to differences in education or political participation. Results emphasize the importance and utility of including economic variables in mapping spatial risk assessments of disease. © 2010 Harrigan et al.

N2  - We study the spread of susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) infectious diseases where an individual's infectiousness and probability of recovery depend on his/her "age" of infection. We focus first on early outbreak stages when stochastic effects dominate and show that epidemics tend to happen faster than deterministic calculations predict. If an outbreak is sufficiently large, stochastic effects are negligible and we modify the standard ordinary differential equation (ODE) model to accommodate age-of-infection effects. We avoid the use of partial differential equations which typically appear in related models. We introduce a "memoryless" ODE system which approximates the true solutions. Finally, we analyze the transition from the stochastic to the deterministic phase.

N2  - Background. Cholera remains a serious public health problem in low-income countries despite efforts in the past to promote oral rehydration therapy as major treatment. In 2007, the majority of worldwide cases (94%) and deaths (99%) were reported from Africa. To improve cholera control efforts in addition to maintaining and improving existing water supply, sanitation and hygiene behaviour measures, the World Health Organization has recently started to consider the use of vaccines as an additional public health tool. To assess this new approach in endemic settings, a project was launched in Zanzibar to vaccinate 50,000 individuals living in communities at high risk of cholera with an oral two-dose vaccine (Dukoral). Immunisation programmes in low-income countries have suffered a reduced coverage or were even brought to a halt because of an ignorance of local realities. To ensure the success of vaccination campaigns, implementers have to consider community-held perceptions and behaviours regarding the infectious disease and the vaccine of interest. The main aim of this study is to provide advice to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Zanzibar regarding routine introduction of an oral cholera vaccine from a socioeconomic and behavioural perspective as part of a long-term development for a sustained cholera prevention strategy. Methods and design. Qualitative and quantitative methods of health social science research will be applied on four stakeholder levels before and after the mass vaccination campaign. Rapid assessment individual interviews and focus groups will be used to describe cholera- and vaccine-related views of policy makers, health care professionals and community representatives. The cultural epidemiological approach will be employed on the individual household resident level in a repeated cross-sectional design to estimate determinants of anticipated and actual oral cholera vaccine acceptance. Discussion. The study presented here is designed to inform about people's perceptions regarding cholera and about socioeconomic and behavioural factors determining anticipated and actual oral cholera vaccine acceptance in Zanzibar. Its pre- and post-intervention design using a mixed-methods approach on different stakeholder levels in communities at high risk of cholera outbreaks will ensure the collection of locally valid data relevant for public health action and planning.

T1  - Persistence of canine distemper virus in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem's carnivore community
A1  - Almberg E.S.
A1  - Cross P.C.
A1  - Smith D.W. 
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Canine distemper virus (CDV) is an acute, highly immunizing pathogen that should require high densities and large populations of hosts for long-term persistence, yet CDV persists among terrestrial carnivores with small, patchily distributed groups. We used CDV in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem's (GYE) wolves (Canis lupus) and coyotes (Canis latrans) as a case study for exploring how metapopulation structure, host demographics, and multi-host transmission affect the critical community size and spatial scale required for CDV persistence. We illustrate how host spatial connectivity and demographic turnover interact to affect both local epidemic dynamics, such as the length and variation in inter-epidemic periods, and pathogen persistence using stochastic, spatially explicit susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered simulation models. Given the apparent absence of other known persistence mechanisms (e.g., a carrier or environmental state, densely populated host, chronic infection, or a vector), we suggest that CDV requires either large spatial scales or multi-host transmission for persistence. Current GYE wolf populations are probably too small to support endemic CDV. Coyotes are a plausible reservoir host, but CDV would still require 50 000-100 000 individuals for moderate persistence (>50% over 10 years), which would equate to an area of 1-3 times the size of the GYE (60000-200000 km2). Coyotes, and carnivores in general, are not uniformly distributed; therefore, this is probably a gross underestimate of the spatial scale of CDV persistence. However, the presence of a second competent host species can greatly increase the probability of long-term CDV persistence at much smaller spatial scales. Although no management of CDV is currently recommended for the GYE, wolf managers in the region should expect periodic but unpredictable CDV-related population declines as often as every 2-5 years. Awareness and monitoring of such outbreaks will allow corresponding adjustments in management activities such as regulated public harvest, creating a smooth transition to state wolf management and conservation after >30 years of being protected by the Endangered Species Act. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.

N2  - Background Many low- and middle-income countries are not on track to reach the public health targets set out in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We evaluated whether differential progress towards health MDGs was associated with economic development, public health funding (both overall and as percentage of available domestic funds), or health system infrastructure. We also examined the impact of joint epidemics of HIV/AIDS and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), which may limit the ability of households to address child mortality and increase risks of infectious diseases. Methods and Findings We calculated each country's distance from its MDG goals for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and infant and child mortality targets for the year 2005 using the United Nations MDG database for 227 countries from 1990 to the present. We studied the association of economic development (gross domestic product [GDP] per capita in purchasing-power-parity), the relative priority placed on health (health spending as a percentage of GDP), real health spending (health system expenditures in purchasing-power-parity), HIV/AIDS burden (prevalence rates among ages 15-49 y), and NCD burden (age-standardised chronic disease mortality rates), with measures of distance from attainment of health MDGs. To avoid spurious correlations that may exist simply because countries with high disease burdens would be expected to have low MDG progress, and to adjust for potential confounding arising from differences in countries' initial disease burdens, we analysed the variations in rates of change in MDG progress versus expected rates for each country. While economic development, health priority, health spending, and health infrastructure did not explain more than one-fifth of the differences in progress to health MDGs among countries, burdens of HIV and NCDs explained more than half of between-country inequalities in child mortality progress (R2-infant mortality = 0.57, R2-under 5 mortality = 0.54). HIV/AIDS and NCD burdens were also the strongest correlates of unequal progress towards tuberculosis goals (R2 = 0.57), with NCDs having an effect independent of HIV/AIDS, consistent with micro-level studies of the influence of tobacco and diabetes on tuberculosis risks. Even after correcting for health system variables, initial child mortality, and tuberculosis diseases, we found that lower burdens of HIV/AIDS and NCDs were associated with much greater progress towards attainment of child mortality and tuberculosis MDGs than were gains in GDP. An estimated 1% lower HIV prevalence or 10% lower mortality rate from NCDs would have a similar impact on progress towards the tuberculosis MDG as an 80% or greater rise in GDP, corresponding to at least a decade of economic growth in low-income countries. Conclusions Unequal progress in health MDGs in low-income countries appears significantly related to burdens of HIV and NCDs in a population, after correcting for potentially confounding socioeconomic, disease burden, political, and health system variables. The common separation between NCDs, child mortality, and infectious syndromes among development programs may obscure interrelationships of illness affecting those living in poor households-whether economic (e.g., as money spent on tobacco is lost from child health expenditures) or biological (e.g., as diabetes or HIV enhance the risk of tuberculosis). © 2010 Stuckler et al.

T1  - Invasion dynamics in spatially heterogeneous environments
A1  - Schreiber S.J.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Biological invasions, including infectious disease out-breaks and biocontrol introductions, often involve small numbers of individuals arriving in spatially heterogeneous environments. Small numbers lead to demographic stochasticity, and spatial heterogeneity means that establishment success depends critically on the intro-duction sites and movement patterns of invaders. We present a gen-eral stochastic modeling framework to address how spatial hetero-geneity and movement patterns determine establishment success, population growth, and rates of spatial spread. For dispersal-limited populations, our analysis reveals that spatial heterogeneity increases the expected population growth rate and that local reproductive numbers determine establishment success. Higher dispersal rates de-crease the expected population growth rate but can enhance establishment success, particularly when movement patterns are positively correlated with local reproductive numbers. We also find that several small, randomly distributed propagules of invaders are more likely to succeed than a single large propagule. Even if invasions are ul-timately successful, there may be substantial time lags before an invader reaches observable densities. These time lags are longer for invasions into patches where extinction risk is high and in landscapes where metapopulation-scale population growth rate is low, while the opposite holds true for rates of spatial spread. Sensitivity analysis of our models provides guidance for control efforts. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

N2  - Background. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a recently reemerged arbovirus responsible for a massive outbreak of infection in the Indian Ocean region and India that has a very significant potential to spread globally because of the worldwide distribution of its mosquito vectors. CHIKV induces a usually self-limited disease in humans that is characterized by fever, arthralgia, myalgia, and rash; however, cases of severe CHIKV infection have recently been described, particularly in adults with underlying condition and neonates born to viremic mothers. Methods. Human polyvalent immunoglobulins were purified from plasma samples obtained from donors in the convalescent phase of CHIKV infection, and the preventive and curative effects of these immunoglobulins were investigated in 2 mouse models of CHIKV infection that we developed. Results. CHIKV immunoglobulins contain anti-CHIKV antibodies and exhibit a high in vitro neutralizing activity and a powerful prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against CHIKV infection in vivo, including in the neonate. Conclusions. Administration of CHIKV immunoglobulins may constitute a safe and efficacious prevention strategy and treatment for individuals exposed to CHIKV who are at risk of severe infection, such as neonates born to viremic mothers and adults with underlying conditions. These results provide a proof-of-concept for purifying human immunoglobulins from plasma samples from patients in the convalescent phase of an emerging infectious disease for which neither prevention nor treatment is available. © 2009 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

N2  - The extent to which self-adopted or intervention-related changes in behaviors affect the course of epidemics remains a key issue for outbreak control. This study attempted to quantify the effect of such changes on the risk of infection in different settings, i.e., the community and hospitals. The 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong, where 27% of cases were healthcare workers, was used as an example. A stochastic compartmental SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) model was used: the population was split into healthcare workers, hospitalized people and general population. Super spreading events (SSEs) were taken into account in the model. The temporal evolutions of the daily effective contact rates in the community and hospitals were modeled with smooth functions. Data augmentation techniques and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were applied to estimate SARS epidemiological parameters. In particular, estimates of daily reproduction numbers were provided for each subpopulation. The average duration of the SARS infectious period was estimated to be 9.3 days (+/-0.3 days). The model was able to disentangle the impact of the two SSEs from background transmission rates. The effective contact rates, which were estimated on a daily basis, decreased with time, reaching zero inside hospitals. This observation suggests that public health measures and possible changes in individual behaviors effectively reduced transmission, especially in hospitals. The temporal patterns of reproduction numbers were similar for healthcare workers and the general population, indicating that on average, an infectious healthcare worker did not infect more people than any other infectious person. We provide a general method to estimate time dependence of parameters in structured epidemic models, which enables investigation of the impact of control measures and behavioral changes in different settings. © 2009 Cori et al.

N2  - In recent years the control of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes has increasingly become a concern. We evaluated the measures (stamping out, controlled marketing, emergency and preventive vaccination, farm density reduction and restocking in homogenous areas) implemented to control the LPAI epidemics that occurred in Italy between 2000 and 2005, using a combination of spatial and space-time analyses and estimates of the basic reproduction ratio (R0). Clustering of infected farms decreased over the years, indicating the effectiveness of the control strategies implemented. Controlled marketing [relative risk (RR) 046, 95% confidence interval (CI) 027-080], emergency (RR 047, 95% CI 039-057) and preventive vaccination (RR 019, 95% CI 009-041) were the most effective measures, yet R0<1 was only for preventive vaccination. Our results are useful for identifying the most effective measures for reducing the risk of the spread of LPAI and optimizing the allocation of resources.

T1  - Impact of the infection period distribution on the epidemic spread in a metapopulation model
A1  - Vergu E.
A1  - Busson H.
A1  - Ezanno P. 
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Epidemic models usually rely on the assumption of exponentially distributed sojourn times in infectious states. This is sometimes an acceptable approximation, but it is generally not realistic and it may influence the epidemic dynamics as it has already been shown in one population. Here, we explore the consequences of choosing constant or gamma-distributed infectious periods in a metapopulation context. For two coupled populations, we show that the probability of generating no secondary infections is the largest for most parameter values if the infectious period follows an exponential distribution, and we identify special cases where, inversely, the infection is more prone to extinction in early phases for constant infection durations. The impact of the infection duration distribution on the epidemic dynamics of many connected populations is studied by simulation and sensitivity analysis, taking into account the potential interactions with other factors. The analysis based on the average nonextinct epidemic trajectories shows that their sensitivity to the assumption on the infectious period distribution mostly depends on R0, the mean infection duration and the network structure. This study shows that the effect of assuming exponential distribution for infection periods instead of more realistic distributions varies with respect to the output of interest and to other factors. Ultimately it highlights the risk of misleading recommendations based on modelling results when models including exponential infection durations are used for practical purposes. © 2010 Vergu et al.

N2  - This report updates the 1993 recommendations by CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding the prevention of Japanese encephalitis (JE) among travelers (CDC. Inactivated Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 1993;42[No. RR-1]). This report summarizes the epidemiology of JE, describes the two JE vaccines that are licensed in the United States, and provides recommendations for their use among travelers and laboratory workers. JE virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is the most common vaccine-preventable cause of encephalitis in Asia. JE occurs throughout most of Asia and parts of the western Pacific. Among an estimated 35,000-50,000 annual cases, 20%-30% of patients die, and 30%-50% of survivors have neurologic or psychiatric sequelae. No treatment exists. For most travelers to Asia, the risk for JE is very low but varies on the basis of destination, duration, season, and activities. JE vaccine is recommended for travelers who plan to spend a month or longer in endemic areas during the JEV transmission season and for laboratory workers with a potential for exposure to infectious JEV. JE vaccine should be considered for 1) short-term (<1 month) travelers to endemic areas during the JEV transmission season if they plan to travel outside of an urban area and will have an increased risk for JEV exposure; 2) travelers to an area with an ongoing JE outbreak; and 3) travelers to endemic areas who are uncertain of specific destinations, activities, or duration of travel. JE vaccine is not recommended for short-term travelers whose visit will be restricted to urban areas or times outside of a well-defined JEV transmission season. Two JE vaccines are licensed in the United States. An inactivated mouse brain--derived JE vaccine (JE-VAX [JE-MB]) has been licensed since 1992 to prevent JE in persons aged >or=1 year traveling to JE-endemic countries. Supplies of this vaccine are limited because production has ceased. In March 2009, an inactivated Vero cell culture-derived vaccine (IXIARO [JE-VC]) was licensed for use in persons aged >or=17 years. JE-MB is the only JE vaccine available for use in children aged 1-16 years, and remaining supplies will be reserved for use in this group.

N2  - Background: Since its first occurrence in the New York City area during 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) has spread rapidly across North America and has become a major public health concern in North America. By 2002, WNV was reported in 40 states and the District of Columbia with 4,156 human and 14,539 equine cases of infection. Mississippi had the highest human incidence rate of WNV during the 2002 epidemic in the United States. Epidemics of WNV can impose enormous impacts on local economies. Therefore, it is advantageous to predict human WNV risks for cost-effective controls of the disease and optimal allocations of limited resources. Understanding relationships between precipitation and WNV transmission is crucial for predicting the risk of the human WNV disease outbreaks under predicted global climate change scenarios. Method(s): We analyzed data on the human WNV incidences in the 82 counties of Mississippi in 2002, using standard morbidity ratio (SMR) and Bayesian hierarchical models, to determine relationships between precipitation and human WNV risks. We also entertained spatial autocorrelations of human WNV risks with conditional autocorrelative (CAR) models, implemented in WinBUGS 1.4.3. Result(s): We observed an inverse relationship between county-level human WNV incidence risk and total annual rainfall during the previous year. Parameters representing spatial heterogeneity in the risk of human exposure to WNV improved model fit. Annual precipitation of the previous year was a predictor of spatial variation of WNV risk. Conclusion(s): Our results have broad implications for risk assessment of WNV and forecasting WNV outbreaks. Assessing risk of vector-born infectious diseases will require understanding of complex ecological relationships. Based on the climatologically characteristic drought occurrence in the past and on climate model predictions for climate change and potentially greater drought occurrence in the future, we suggest that the frequency and relative risk of WNV outbreaks could increase. © 2010 Wang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

T1  - Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome following water contamination
A1  - Marshall J.K. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) is a common disorder wherein symptoms of IBS begin after an episode of acute gastroenteritis. The Walkerton Health Study (WHS) was initiated in 2002 to study the long-term outcomes of tragic contamination of its municipal water supply with Escherichia coli and Campylobacter species in 2000. Within a cohort of 2069 adult Walkerton residents with no prior history of chronic gastrointestinal disorders, the incidence of PI-IBS 2 years after the outbreak was 10.1% among subjects with no acute gastroenteritis vs 36.2% among those with clinically suspected gastroenteritis (P<0.001). Long-term follow-up of the WHS cohort has shown PI-IBS to have a favorable prognosis, with spontaneous remission in most patients. A recent meta-analysis of nine cohort studies estimated the pooled odds ratio for developing IBS after enteric infection to be 5.86 (95% CI 3.60-9.54). Risk factors for PI-IBS include female gender, younger age, more severe acute enteric infection, and psychiatric comorbidity. A prevailing hypothesis is that PI-IBS results from a failure to downregulate inflammation after an acute insult from gastroenteritis, a model supported by preliminary studies of intestinal permeability and pro-inflammatory genotypes. Ongoing research is testing the hypothesis that PI-IBS denotes increased susceptibility to more overt inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's disease. Although the Walkerton outbreak of acute gastroenteritis was an awful human tragedy, it is hoped that the WHS will advance our understanding of PI-IBS and improve the outcomes of people who suffer similar tragedies in the future. © 2009 International Society of Nephrology.

T1  - Model-based evaluation of highly and low pathogenic avian influenza dynamics in wild birds
A1  - Henaux V.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - There is growing interest in avian influenza (AI) epidemiology to predict disease risk in wild and domestic birds, and prevent transmission to humans. However, understanding the epidemic dynamics of highly pathogenic (HPAI) viruses remains challenging because they have rarely been detected in wild birds. We used modeling to integrate available scientific information from laboratory and field studies, evaluate AI dynamics in individual hosts and waterfowl populations, and identify key areas for future research. We developed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model and used published laboratory challenge studies to estimate epidemiological parameters (rate of infection, latency period, recovery and mortality rates), considering the importance of age classes, and virus pathogenicity. Infectious contact leads to infection and virus shedding within 1-2 days, followed by relatively slower period for recovery or mortality. We found a shorter infectious period for HPAI than low pathogenic (LP) AI, which may explain that HPAI has been much harder to detect than LPAI during surveillance programs. Our model predicted a rapid LPAI epidemic curve, with a median duration of infection of 50-60 days and no fatalities. In contrast, HPAI dynamics had lower prevalence and higher mortality, especially in young birds. Based on field data from LPAI studies, our model suggests to increase surveillance for HPAI in post-breeding areas, because the presence of immunologically nai{dotless}ve young birds is predicted to cause higher HPAI prevalence and bird losses during this season. Our results indicate a better understanding of the transmission, infection, and immunity-related processes is required to refine predictions of AI risk and spread, improve surveillance for HPAI in wild birds, and develop disease control strategies to reduce potential transmission to domestic birds and/or humans.

N2  - Mathematical simulation modelling of epidemic processes has recently become a popular tool in guiding policy decisions for potential disease outbreaks. Such models all rely on various parameters in order to specify quantities such as transmission and detection rates. However, the values of these parameters are peculiar to an individual outbreak, and estimating them in advance of an epidemic has been the major difficulty in the predictive credibility of such approaches. The obstruction to classical approaches in estimating model parameters has been that of missing data: (i) an infected individual is only detected after the onset of clinical signs, we never observe the time of infection directly; (ii) if we wish to make inference on an epidemic while it is in progress (in order to predict how it might unfold in the future), we must take into account the fact that there may be individuals who are infected but not yet detected. In this paper we apply a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to a combined spatial and contact network model constructed in a Bayesian context to provide a real-time risk prediction during an epidemic. Using the example of a potential Avian H5N1 epidemic in the UK poultry industry, we demonstrate how such a technique can be used to give real-time predictions of quantities such as the probability of individual poultry holdings becoming infected, the risk that individual holdings pose to the population if they become infected, and the number and whereabouts of infected, but not yet detected, holdings. Since the methodology generalises easily to many epidemic situations, we anticipate its use as a real-time decision-support tool for targetting disease control to critical transmission processes, and for monitoring the efficacy of current control policy. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Bovine brucellosis is a major animal health problem in the Republic of Korea. Further, a number of human cases of brucellosis have recently been detected. This paper provides an overview of surveillance (to detect new cases) and control (to clear infection following case detection) of bovine brucellosis in the Republic of Korea during 2000-2006. Using data from AIMS (the national animal infectious disease data management system), we conducted separate descriptive analyses, initially using farm and then episode as our unit of interest. An episode was defined as a period of compulsory herd trading restriction, following detection of infection with Brucella abortus in one or more cattle. We also identified risk factors for two measures of disease control: episode duration (logistic generalised estimating equation model) and time to re-restriction (Cox's proportional-hazard model). There were 8530 and 52,739 reactor farms and reactor cattle, respectively, during 2000-2006. From 2004 to 2006, there was a substantial increase in the number of new outbreaks, particularly within the beef sector. The probability of a prolonged episode (>150 days) and the hazard of a second episode each increased with herd size. Further, the hazard of a second episode was higher in 2005 (compared with other years) and in the southeast of Korea (compared with other provinces). The effect of outbreak size on control varied between the beef and dairy sectors. The increase in beef cattle reactors in 2004-2006 is closely aligned to an increase in surveillance effort. Nonetheless, it is likely that this is a genuine reflection of the recent establishment and spread of brucellosis in the Korean beef cattle population. The recent increase in surveillance coverage in the beef sector is central to national eradication efforts. Current strategies to control infection following detection have generally been effective, leading to rapid clearance of infection on most farms. Control becomes problematic with increasing herd size. This work provides a detailed insight into surveillance and control of bovine brucellosis in Korea, and should assist both policy-makers and field veterinarians to improve the effectiveness of national eradication efforts. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Review and comparison between the Wells-Riley and dose-response approaches to risk assessment of infectious respiratory diseases
A1  - Sze To G.N.
A1  - Chao C.Y.H. 
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Infection risk assessment is very useful in understanding the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and in predicting the risk of these diseases to the public. Quantitative infection risk assessment can provide quantitative analysis of disease transmission and the effectiveness of infection control measures. The Wells-Riley model has been extensively used for quantitative infection risk assessment of respiratory infectious diseases in indoor premises. Some newer studies have also proposed the use of dose-response models for such purpose. This study reviews and compares these two approaches to infection risk assessment of respiratory infectious diseases. The Wells-Riley model allows quick assessment and does not require interspecies extrapolation of infectivity. Dose-response models can consider other disease transmission routes in addition to airborne route and can calculate the infectious source strength of an outbreak in terms of the quantity of the pathogen rather than a hypothetical unit. Spatial distribution of airborne pathogens is one of the most important factors in infection risk assessment of respiratory disease. Respiratory deposition of aerosol induces heterogeneous infectivity of intake pathogens and randomness on the intake dose, which are not being well accounted for in current risk models. Some suggestions for further development of the risk assessment models are proposed. Practical Implications This review article summarizes the strengths and limitations of the Wells-Riley and the dose-response models for risk assessment of respiratory diseases. Even with many efforts by various investigators to develop and modify the risk assessment models, some limitations still persist. This review serves as a reference for further development of infection risk assessment models of respiratory diseases. The Wells-Riley model and dose-response model offer specific advantages. Risk assessors can select the approach that is suitable to their particular conditions to perform risk assessment. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

T1  - Calculating the potential for within-flight transmission of influenza A (H1N1)
A1  - Wagner B.G.
A1  - Coburn B.J.
A1  - Blower S. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Background: Clearly air travel, by transporting infectious individuals from one geographic location to another, significantly affects the rate of spread of influenza A (H1N1). However, the possibility of within-flight transmission of H1N1 has not been evaluated; although it is known that smallpox, measles, tuberculosis, SARS and seasonal influenza can be transmitted during commercial flights. Here we present the first quantitative risk assessment to assess the potential for within-flight transmission of H1N1. Method(s): We model airborne transmission of infectious viral particles of H1N1 within a Boeing 747 using methodology from the field of quantitative microbial risk assessment. Result(s): The risk of catching H1N1 will essentially be confined to passengers travelling in the same cabin as the source case. Not surprisingly, we find that the longer the flight the greater the number of infections that can be expected. We calculate that H1N1, even during long flights, poses a low to moderate within-flight transmission risk if the source case travels First Class. Specifically, 0-1 infections could occur during a 5 hour flight, 1-3 during an 11 hour flight and 2-5 during a 17 hour flight. However, within-flight transmission could be significant, particularly during long flights, if the source case travels in Economy Class. Specifically, two to five infections could occur during a 5 hour flight, 5-10 during an 11 hour flight and 7-17 during a 17 hour flight. If the aircraft is only partially loaded, under certain conditions more infections could occur in First Class than in Economy Class. During a 17 hour flight, a greater number of infections would occur in First Class than in Economy if the First Class Cabin is fully occupied, but Economy class is less than 30% full. Conclusion(s): Our results provide insights into the potential utility of air travel restrictions on controlling influenza pandemics in the winter of 2009/2010. They show travel by one infectious individual, rather than causing a single outbreak of H1N1, could cause several simultaneous outbreaks. These results imply that, during a pandemic, quarantining passengers who travel in Economy on long-haul flights could potentially be an important control strategy. Notably, our results show that quarantining passengers who travel First Class would be unlikely to be an effective control strategy. © 2009 Wagner et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

T1  - A simulation analysis to characterize the dynamics of vaccinating behaviour on contact networks
A1  - Perisic A.
A1  - Bauch C.T. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Background: Human behavior influences infectious disease transmission, and numerous "prevalence-behavior" models have analyzed this interplay. These previous analyses assumed homogeneously mixing populations without spatial or social structure. However, spatial and social heterogeneity are known to significantly impact transmission dynamics and are particularly relevant for certain diseases. Previous work has demonstrated that social contact structure can change the individual incentive to vaccinate, thus enabling eradication of a disease under a voluntary vaccination policy when the corresponding homogeneous mixing model predicts that eradication is impossible due to free rider effects. Here, we extend this work and characterize the range of possible behavior-prevalence dynamics on a network. Method(s): We simulate transmission of a vaccine-prevetable infection through a random, static contact network. Individuals choose whether or not to vaccinate on any given day according to perceived risks of vaccination and infection. Result(s): We find three possible outcomes for behavior-prevalence dynamics on this type of network: small final number vaccinated and final epidemic size (due to rapid control through voluntary ring vaccination); large final number vaccinated and significant final epidemic size (due to imperfect voluntary ring vaccination), and little or no vaccination and large final epidemic size (corresponding to little or no voluntary ring vaccination). We also show that the social contact structure enables eradication under a broad range of assumptions, except when vaccine risk is sufficiently high, the disease risk is sufficiently low, or individuals vaccinate too late for the vaccine to be effective. Conclusion(s): For populations where infection can spread only through social contact network, relatively small differences in parameter values relating to perceived risk or vaccination behavior at the individual level can translate into large differences in population-level outcomes such as final size and final number vaccinated. The qualitative outcome of rational, self interested behaviour under a voluntary vaccination policy can vary substantially depending on interactions between social contact structure, perceived vaccine and disease risks, and the way that individual vaccination decision-making is modelled. © 2009 Perisic and Bauch; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Background: In infectious disease surveillance, when the laboratory confirmation of the cases is time-consuming, there is often a time lag between the number of suspect cases and the number of confirmed cases. This study proposes a dynamic statistical model to estimate the daily number of new cases and the daily cumulative number of infected cases, which was then applied to historic dengue fever data. Method(s): The duration between the date of disease onset and date of laboratory confirmation was assumed to follow a gamma distribution or a nonparametric distribution. A conditional probability of a case being a real case among the unconfirmed cases on a given date was then calculated. This probability along with the observed confirmed cases was integrated to estimate the daily number of new cases and the cumulative number of infected cases. Result(s): The distribution of the onset-to-confirmation time for the positive cases was different from that of the negative cases. The daily new cases and cumulative epidemic curves estimated by the proposed method have a lower absolute relative bias than the values estimated solely based on the available daily-confirmed cases. Conclusion(s): The proposed method provides a more accurate real-time estimation of the daily new cases and daily cumulative number of infected cases. The model makes use of the most recent "moving window" of information relative to suspect cases and dynamically updates the parameters. The proposed method will be useful for the real-time evaluation of a disease outbreak when case classification requires a time-consuming laboratory process to identify a confirmed case. © 2010 Chuang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Transmission of foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus by infected animals may already occur before clinical signs are evident. Quantitative data for FMD transmission rates during this so-called high-risk period are currently lacking and would provide useful information to develop surveillance systems in which the number of new outbreaks is an outcome variable. In order to address this, we used experimental data to quantify transmission in cattle, swine and sheep during the non-clinical phase of the disease. Groups consisted of vaccinated or non-vaccinated animals of one species; half of each group was inoculated with FMDV, the other half was contact-exposed. We estimated the reproduction ratio Rnonclin using a mathematical SIR model. Rnonclin was defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by one infectious individual in its non-clinical phase. Animals not showing clinical signs shed lower amounts of virus than clinically affected ones. Therefore, we estimated transmission proportionally to the virus excretion. Low estimates for Rnonclin in groups with non-vaccinated and vaccinated calves; 0.30 [0.03; 3.43] and 1.03 x 10-8 [0; ] respectively and 0.21 [0.02; 2.48] for the non-vaccinated and 0.16 [0.009; 2.96] for the vaccinated lambs, were observed. These results indicate that only few secondary infections are to be expected from infected calves and lambs when they are not clinically affected. In groups of non-vaccinated piglets estimates were Rnonclin = 13.20 [4.08; 42.68], and in vaccinated piglets Rnonclin = 1.26 [0.18; 8.96]. The estimate for Rnonclin for non-vaccinated dairy cows was Rnonclin = 176.65 [80.38; 388.24], whereas Rnonclin in the vaccinated groups could not be estimated. Our findings suggest that a large number of individuals might have been infected before clinical signs are noticed, especially in non-vaccinated swine and dairy herds. These findings suggest that after clinical recognition of FMD, priority should be given to trace back contacts with swine and dairy farms, as they may already have been infectious in the herd's incubation period.

N2  - Background. The Canadian province of British Columbia has experienced an ongoing heterosexual infectious syphilis epidemic since July 1997. In this study, we sought to characterize individuals who received a diagnosis of syphilis more than once in a cohort of reported cases from 1995 through 2005 in British Columbia. Methods. Data for all cases of primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis from 1 January 1995 through 31 December 2005 were extracted from the British Columbia Provincial Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Database. A descriptive analysis was conducted on all variables from the cases, and the incidence density ofsyphilis rediagnosis was calculated. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazards regression techniques to compare those who received a syphilis diagnosis once with those who received a syphilis diagnosis more than once within the 10-year period. Results. By 2006, up to 10% of new cases of syphilis in the province were attributed to individuals who had received a previous diagnosis of syphilis within the preceding 10 years. In Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, individuals with the following characteristics were associated with an increased risk of becoming reinfect- ed with syphilis: human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity, history of ever having gonorrhea or chlamydia, aboriginal ethnicity, and being a man who had sex with men. Conclusions. In this study, an increasing proportion of syphilis cases in British Columbia were attributed to a rediagnosis during the previous decade. Individuals with syphilis rediagnosis may represent a core group of transmitters who continue to engage in risky behavior and sustain the epidemic. Policies for prevention need to better consider the role of interventions to decrease rates of repeat diagnoses of sexually transmitted infections. © 2009 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

N2  - Exposure to the risk of neighbourhood infection was estimated for the H7N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) epidemic that affected Northern Italy between 1999 and 2000. The two most affected regions (Lombardy and Veneto) were analyzed and the epidemic was divided into three phases. Q statistics were used to evaluate exposure to the risk of neighbourhood infection using two measures. First, a local Q statistic (Qikt) assessed daily exposure for each farm as a function of the number of neighbouring infected farms that were in their infectious period, weighted by the distance between farms. This allowed us to identify the daily time course of risk for each farm and, at any given time, local groups of farms defined by high risk. Second, for each farm a summary statistic of exposure risk within each phase (Qiph) was obtained by summing Qikt over the duration of each phase. This allowed identification of farms defined by persistent, high exposure risk within each phase of the epidemic. Statistical significance was evaluated using conditional Monte Carlo simulation, and significant values of Qiph were mapped to assess the variation of the risk of neighbourhood infection through the phases. Qikt was larger for farms in Lombardy and the reduction of exposed farms was more marked for Veneto. Although the highest value of Qiph was observed in Veneto, in each phase most of the significant values were in Lombardy. In the last phase of the epidemic, a large reduction in the number of farms significantly exposed to the risk of neighbourhood infection was observed in the Veneto region, along with generally low values of Qiph. This may be explained by differences in control measures in the two regions, including pre-emptive slaughtering of farms considered at high risk of infection. The Q statistic allowed us to quantify geographic, time-dynamic variations in exposure to neighbourhood infection, and to generate hypotheses on the efficacy of control measures. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of acquiring emerging infections while caring for patients, as has been shown in the recent SARS and swine flu epidemics. Using SARS as an example, we determined the effectiveness of infection control measures (ICMs) by logistic regression and structural equation modelling (SEM), a quantitative methodology that can test a hypothetical model and validates causal relationships among ICMs. Logistic regression showed that installing hand wash stations in the emergency room (p 0.012, odds ratio 1.07) was the only ICM significantly associated with the protection of HCWs from acquiring the SARS virus. The structural equation modelling results showed that the most important contributing factor (highest proportion of effectiveness) was installation of a fever screening station outside the emergency department (51%). Other measures included traffic control in the emergency department (19%), availability of an outbreak standard operation protocol (12%), mandatory temperature screening (9%), establishing a hand washing setup at each hospital checkpoint (3%), adding simplified isolation rooms (3%), and a standardized patient transfer protocol (3%). Installation of fever screening stations outside of the hospital and implementing traffic control in the emergency department contributed to 70% of the effectiveness in the prevention of SARS transmission. Our approach can be applied to the evaluation of control measures for other epidemic infectious diseases, including swine flu and avian flu. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Background: Emerging infectious diseases in wildlife are major threats for both human health and biodiversity conservation. Infectious diseases can have serious consequences for the genetic diversity of populations, which could enhance the species' extinction probability. The Ebola epizootic in western and central Africa induced more than 90% mortality in Western lowland gorilla population. Although mortality rates are very high, the impacts of Ebola on genetic diversity of Western lowland gorilla have never been assessed. Methodology/Principal Findings: We carried out long term studies of three populations of Western lowland gorilla in the Republic of the Congo (Odzala-Kokoua National Park, Lossi gorilla sanctuary both affected by Ebola and Lossi's periphery not affected). Using 17 microsatellite loci, we compared genetic diversity and structure of the populations and estimate their effective size before and after Ebola outbreaks. Despite the effective size decline in both populations, we did not detect loss in genetic diversity after the epizootic. We revealed temporal changes in allele frequencies in the smallest population. Conclusions/Significance: Immigration and short time elapsed since outbreaks could explain the conservation of genetic diversity after the demographic crash. Temporal changes in allele frequencies could not be explained by genetic drift or random sampling. Immigration from genetically differentiated populations and a non random mortality induced by Ebola, i. e., selective pressure and cost of sociality, are alternative hypotheses. Understanding the influence of Ebola on gorilla genetic dynamics is of paramount importance for human health, primate evolution and conservation biology. © 2009 Le Gouar et al.

T1  - Additive-multiplicative regression models for spatio-temporal epidemics
A1  - Hohle M. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - An extension of the stochastic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model is proposed in order to accommodate a regression context for modelling infectious disease data. The proposal is based on a multivariate counting process specified by conditional intensities, which contain an additive epidemic component and a multiplicative endemic component. This allows the analysis of endemic infectious diseases by quantifying risk factors for infection by external sources in addition to infective contacts. Inference can be performed by considering the full likelihood of the stochastic process with additional parameter restrictions to ensure non-negative conditional intensities. Simulation from the model can be performed by Ogata's modified thinning algorithm. As an illustrative example, we analyse data provided by the Federal Research Centre for Virus Diseases of Animals, Wusterhausen, Germany, on the incidence of the classical swine fever virus in Germany during 1993-2004.

N2  - Rainbow trout gastroenteritis (RTGE) is an emerging disease of farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) reported in Croatia, France, Italy, Spain and the UK. The impact of RTGE at the site-level varies, and daily mortalities of 0.5-1% are common. Gross lesions include severe enteritis with congestion and oedema, and the segmented filamentous bacterium "Candidatus arthromitus" has been suggested as a possible aetiological agent. This paper presents findings from a prospective longitudinal epidemiology study that took place from June to November 2006 in 12 RTGE-positive UK sites, examining the impact and presentation of the disease, spread pattern, risk factors for disease presence and severity and the efficacy of current control strategies. RTGE was present in a total of 164 production units across the 12 sites, representing 39% of all stocked units. Fish losses due to RTGE totalled 61.4 tonnes. The plotting of epidemic curves revealed a propagating epidemic pattern in 51% affected units, suggesting RTGE is infectious. This was supported by risk analysis of fish transfers and site layouts, which revealed an increased risk of becoming RTGE positive after contiguity or fish transfer to and from a previously affected unit. Conditional multivariate logistic regression analysis identified eight variables significantly associated with the presence of RTGE. Seven variables were risk factors, including higher stocking densities, mortalities due to predation or handling, higher water temperature, higher daily feed input and contiguity or fish movement to and from a previous case. One variable was protective: the absence of an aeration system in a unit. General linear modelling identified a significant association of mean feed input per fish during an outbreak with RTGE cumulative mortality. Finally, great variability was observed with regards to the control strategies targeted to RTGE in these sites, suggesting an absence of a common strategy. In feed NaCl treatments apparently presented a palliative effect if given to affected fish during the clinical outbreaks, but they did not prevent recurrence. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Partner concurrency and the STD/HIV epidemic
A1  - Aral S.O. 
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Conceptually and theoretically, it is easy to see how short gaps and concurrent partnerships fuel the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STI) and HIV in populations. The consequences of concurrency are bounded by the duration of the infectious period and by the relationships between concurrent partnerships and other dimensions of sexual behavior. Consequently, it is difficult to predict how concurrent partnerships or short gaps may be related to the spread of STI and HIV in a particular epidemiologic context in empirical reality. In recent years, analyses of sexual behavior data collected through nationally representative surveys revealed similar prevalences of concurrent sexual partnerships in Western populations. The association between concurrent sexual partnerships and STI/HIV risk is complicated. At the population level, recent findings suggest that the ecological association between polygyny and HIV prevalence is negative at the country level and at the sub-national level. To address the need for agreed-upon standard definitions and measures of concurrent sexual partnerships, which will facilitate comparisons across time and settings, the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling, and Projections convened a meeting in April 2009. The recommendations developed at this meeting include suggestions for a definition, indicators, and measures of concurrency. © The Author(s) 2010.

N2  - In low vaccination coverage regions (LVR) in The Netherlands people often reject participation in the National Immunization Programme for religious reasons. During a rubella epidemic in 2004-2005, 32 pregnant women were notified with rubella, and 11 babies were born with defects related to maternal infection. This study presents a cost-utility analysis of a screening and vaccination programme for rubella focusing on three scenarios: (1) screening non-vaccinated pregnant women in LVR; (2) screening all pregnant women in LVR; (3) screening all non-vaccinated pregnant women in The Netherlands (including pregnant first-generation non-Western immigrant women). Cost-utility was estimated over a 16-year period which included two rubella outbreaks. Observed complications from the 2004-2005 epidemic were used to estimate average cost savings and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained. The programme would be cost-effective (1100/QALY gained) when assuming an acceptability of vaccination of 20% in women belonging to orthodox protestant risk groups.

N2  - UNAIDS and country analysts use a simple infectious disease model, embedded in the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP), to generate annual updates on the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. Our objective was to develop modifications to the current model that improve fit to recently observed prevalence trends across countries. Our proposed alternative to the current EPP approach simplifies the model structure and explicitly models changes in average infection risk over time, operationalised using penalised B-splines in a Bayesian framework. We also present an alternative approach to initiating the epidemic that improves standardisation and efficiency, and add an informative prior distribution for changes in infection risk beyond the last data point that enhances the plausibility of short-term extrapolations. The spline-based model produces better fits than the current model to observed prevalence trends in settings that have recently experienced levelling or rising prevalence following a steep decline, such as Uganda and urban Rwanda. The model also predicts a deceleration of the decline in prevalence for countries with recent experience of steady declines, such as Kenya and Zimbabwe. Estimates and projections from our alternative model are comparable to those from the current model where the latter performs well. A more flexible epidemiological model that accommodates changing infection risk over time can provide better estimates and short-term projections of HIV/AIDS incidence, prevalence and mortality than the current EPP model. The alternative model specification can be incorporated easily into existing analytical tools that are used to produce updates on the global HIV/AIDS epidemic.

N2  - Infant mortality is an important indicator of population health in a country. It is associated with several health determinants, such as maternal health, access to high-quality health care, socioeconomic conditions, and public health policy and practices. A spatial-temporal analysis was performed to assess changes in infant mortality patterns between 1992-2007 and to identify factors associated with infant mortality risk in the Agincourt sub-district, rural northeast South Africa. Period, sex, refugee status, maternal and fertility-related factors, household mortality experience, distance to nearest primary health care facility, and socio-economic status were examined as possible risk factors. All-cause and cause-specific mortality maps were developed to identify high risk areas within the study site. The analysis was carried out by fitting Bayesian hierarchical geostatistical negative binomial autoregressive models using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Simulation-based Bayesian kriging was used to produce maps of all-cause and cause-specific mortality risk. Infant mortality increased significantly over the study period, largely due to the impact of the HIV epidemic. There was a high burden of neonatal mortality (especially perinatal) with several hot spots observed in close proximity to health facilities. Significant risk factors for all-cause infant mortality were mother's death in first year (most commonly due to HIV), death of previous sibling and increasing number of household deaths. Being born to a Mozambican mother posed a significant risk for infectious and parasitic deaths, particularly acute diarrhoea and malnutrition. This study demonstrates the use of Bayesian geostatistical models in assessing risk factors and producing smooth maps of infant mortality risk in a health and socio-demographic surveillance system. Results showed marked geographical differences in mortality risk across a relatively small area. Prevention of vertical transmission of HIV and survival of mothers during the infants' first year in high prevalence villages needs to be urgently addressed, including expanded antenatal testing, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and improved access to antiretroviral therapy. There is also need to assess and improve the capacity of district hospitals for emergency obstetric and newborn care. Persisting risk factors, including inadequate provision of clean water and sanitation, are yet to be fully addressed.

N2  - We derive an analytical expression for the critical infection rate r{c} of the susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) disease spreading model on random networks. To obtain r{c}, we first calculate the probability of reinfection pi, defined as the probability of a node to reinfect the node that had earlier infected it. We then derive r{c} from pi using percolation theory. We show that pi is governed by two effects: (i) the requirement from an infecting node to recover prior to its reinfection, which depends on the SIS disease spreading parameters, and (ii) the competition between nodes that simultaneously try to reinfect the same ancestor, which depends on the network topology.

N2  - Little is known about the risk perceptions and attitudes of healthcare personnel, especially of emergency prehospital medical care personnel, regarding the possibility of an outbreak or epidemic event. This study was designed to investigate pre-event knowledge and attitudes of a national sample of the emergency prehospital medical care providers in relation to a potential human influenza pandemic, and to determine predictors of these attitudes. Surveys were distributed to a random, cross-sectional sample of 20% of the Australian emergency prehospital medical care workforce (n = 2,929), stratified by the nine services operating in Australia, as well as by gender and location. The surveys included: (1) demographic information; (2) knowledge of influenza; and (3) attitudes and perceptions related to working during influenza pandemic conditions. Multiple logistic regression models were constructed to identify predictors of pandemic-related risk perceptions. Among the 725 Australian emergency prehospital medical care personnel who responded, 89% were very anxious about working during pandemic conditions, and 85% perceived a high personal risk associated with working in such conditions. In general, respondents demonstrated poor knowledge in relation to avian influenza, influenza generally, and infection transmission methods. Less than 5% of respondents perceived that they had adequate education/training about avian influenza. Logistic regression analyses indicate that, in managing the attitudes and risk perceptions of emergency prehospital medical care staff, particular attention should be directed toward the paid, male workforce (as opposed to volunteers), and on personnel whose relationship partners do not work in the health industry. These results highlight the potentially crucial role of education and training in pandemic preparedness. Organizations that provide emergency prehospital medical care must address this apparent lack of knowledge regarding infection transmission, and procedures for protection and decontamination. Careful management of the perceptions of emergency prehospital medical care personnel during a pandemic is likely to be critical in achieving an effective response to a widespread outbreak of infectious disease.

T1  - Spatial correlation between the prevalence of transmissible spongiform diseases and British soil geochemistry
A1  - Imrie C.E.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a group of fatal neurological conditions affecting a number of mammals, including sheep and goats (scrapie), cows (BSE), and humans (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease). The diseases are widely believed to be caused by the misfolding of the normal prion protein to a pathological isoform, which is thought to act as an infectious agent. Outbreaks of the disease are commonly attributed to contaminated feed and genetic susceptibility. However, the implication of copper and manganese in the pathology of the disease, and its apparent geographical clustering, have prompted suggestions of a link with trace elements in the environment. Nevertheless, studies of soils at regional scales have failed to provide evidence of an environmental risk factor. This study uses geostatistical techniques to investigate the correlations between the distribution of TSE prevalence and soil geochemical variables across the UK according to different spatial scales. A similar spatial pattern in scrapie and BSE occurrence is identified, which may be linked with increasing pH and total organic carbon, and decreasing iodine concentration. However, the pattern also resembles that of the density of dairy farming. Nevertheless, despite the low spatial resolution of the TSE data available for this study, the fact that significant correlations are detected indicates there is a possibility of a link between soil geochemistry, scrapie, and BSE. It is suggested that further investigations of the prevalence of TSE and environmental exposure to trace metals should take into account the factors affecting their bioavailability. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.

N2  - Pancreas disease (PD) is an emerging infectious disease in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) caused by salmonid alphavirus (SAV). The present study is a large scale study aiming at quantifying the probability of contracting PD in farmed salmonid cohorts in Norway due to exposure to risk factors that may be associated with specific transmission pathways for SAV, or may increase a cohort's susceptibility to PD. Monthly reports of numbers of fish and mean fish weight from all marine salmonid farm sites in Norway were used to identify cohorts of farmed salmonids. Only cohorts that were initiated and terminated during 2003-2007 were assembled for the study. Records of clinical diagnosis of PD on marine farm sites were used to identify PD case cohorts. In PD case cohorts, PD-outbreaks were defined to start the month the diagnosis was recorded and last until the cohort was terminated. All cohorts in which PD was not recorded were assigned to the control-class. In total 143 PD case cohorts and 1079 control cohorts were assembled. Risk factors were assigned to the cohorts and analysed using logistic regression by generalized additive models (GAM). We find that infection pressure, a variable designed to capture the potential for local disease spread, has a strong effect on the probability of recording a PD-outbreak in a cohort. The function describing the effect of infection pressure increased steeply as infection pressure increased from 0 to moderate values corresponding to having a mean sized neighbouring fish stock with PD at a distance of 2 km, after which the function levelled off. The study emphasises horizontal transmission pathways as important for the spread of PD in Norwegian salmon farming, and accordingly that bio-security measures aimed at controlling horizontal transmission are necessary in order to reduce the number of outbreaks of PD. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Eosinophilic meningitis (angiostrongyliasis) caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis is emerging in mainland China. However, the distribution of A. cantonensis and its intermediate host snails, and the role of two invasive snail species in the emergence of angiostrongyliasis, are not well understood. Methodology/Principal Findings: A national survey pertaining to A. cantonensis was carried out using a grid sampling approach (spatial resolution: 40x40 km). One village per grid cell was randomly selected from a 5% random sample of grid cells located in areas where the presence of the intermediate host snail Pomacea canaliculata had been predicted based on a degree-day model. Potential intermediate hosts of A. cantonensis were collected in the field, restaurants, markets and snail farms, and examined for infection. The infection prevalence among intermediate host snails was estimated, and the prevalence of A. cantonensis within P. canaliculata was displayed on a map, and predicted for non-sampled locations. It was confirmed that P. canaliculata and Achatina fulica were the predominant intermediate hosts of A. cantonensis in China, and these snails were found to be well established in 11 and six provinces, respectively. Infected snails of either species were found in seven provinces, closely matching the endemic area of A. cantonensis. Infected snails were also found in markets and restaurants. Two clusters of A. cantonensis-infected P. canaliculata were predicted in Fujian and Guangxi provinces. Conclusions/Significance: The first national survey in China revealed a wide distribution of A. cantonensis and two invasive snail species, indicating that a considerable number of people are at risk of angiostrongyliasis. Health education, rigorous food inspection and surveillance are all needed to prevent recurrent angiostrongyliasis outbreaks. © 2009 Lv et al.

N2  - Salmon farming is threatened, economically and ecologically, by infectious diseases. To reduce the risk of epidemics, authorities have developed regulations. These are based on quantitative understanding of pathways of infection, representing disease specific risks. A stochastic model was fitted to historical data, to estimate risk factors associated with competing spread mechanisms. Three infectious diseases were compared, heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI), pancreas disease (PD) and infectious salmon anaemia (ISA). This study was based on space-time data, from Norway from 2003 to 2007, describing the susceptible fish cohorts and the reported infections. Particular interest was given to seaway distances between farms and their local management organisation. The parameter measuring the effect of distance to an infectious fish farm was positive and significant for all diseases, implying that the risk involved with proximate infectious fish farms increased with decreasing distance. For HSMI and PD there was a significant effect of sharing a contact network with an infectious farm. For HSMI, but not for PD or ISA, there was a significant effect of previous infected cohorts on the same farm. The relative contribution of each transmission pathway was dominated by seaway distance for PD and HSMI, while other non-defined pathways dominated for ISA. This comparative study highlights that the three diseases have different patterns of spread, with important consequences for disease prevention and management. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - How microbial community composition regulates coral disease development

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Reef coral cover is in rapid decline worldwide, in part due to bleaching (expulsion of photosynthetic symbionts) and outbreaks of infectious disease. One important factor associated with bleaching and in disease transmission is a shift in the composition of the microbial community in the mucus layer surrounding the coral: the resident microbial community-which is critical to the healthy functioning of the coral holobiont-is replaced by pathogenic microbes, often species of Vibrio. In this paper we develop computational models for microbial community dynamics in the mucus layer in order to understand how the surface microbial community responds to changes in environmental conditions, and under what circumstances it becomes vulnerable to overgrowth by pathogens. Some of our model's assumptions and parameter values are based on Vibrio spp. as a model system for other established and emerging coral pathogens. We find that the pattern of interactions in the surface microbial community facilitates the existence of alternate stable states, one dominated by antibiotic-producing beneficial microbes and the other pathogen-dominated. A shift to pathogen dominance under transient stressful conditions, such as a brief warming spell, may persist long after environmental conditions have returned to normal. This prediction is consistent with experimental findings that antibiotic properties of Acropora palmata mucus did not return to normal long after temperatures had fallen. Long-term loss of antibiotic activity eliminates a critical component in coral defense against disease, giving pathogens an extended opportunity to infect and spread within the host, elevating the risk of coral bleaching, disease, and mortality. © 2010 Mao-Jones et al.

T1  - Immunoglobulins for preventing hepatitis A
A1  - Liu J.P.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Background: Hepatitis A (infectious hepatitis) is a common epidemic disease. Immunoglobulins for passive immunisation are used as prevention. Objective(s): To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of the pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis with immunoglobulins for preventing hepatitis A. Search strategy: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Chinese Biomedical Database, and Science Citation Index Expanded for trials until October 2008. In addition, we read through reference lists of the identified publications and handsearched three journals. Selection Criteria: Randomised clinical trials on immunoglobulin prophylaxis for preventing hepatitis A, irrespective of blinding, publication status, or language. Data Collection and Analysis: Data were extracted by two authors and verified by a third author. Results were presented as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The primary outcome was occurrence of hepatitis A (infectious hepatitis). Main Result(s): We included 13 trials with 567,476 participants randomised to pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis. The trials had high risk of bias. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of study setting, participants, interventions, and outcome measures. Our meta-analysis with six randomised trials showed that immunoglobulins, when used for pre-exposure prophylaxis, significantly reduced the number of adult patients with hepatitis A at 6 to 12 months (1020/286503 versus 761/134529; RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.70; random-effects model) in comparison with no intervention or inactive control. Four trials showed a similar effect in children aged 3 to 17 at 6 to 12 months follow-up (917/210822 versus 677/78960; RR 0.45; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.59). Comparing different doses of immunoglobulins, higher dosage was generallymore effective than lower dosage (1.5ml better than 0.75ml and 0.75ml better than 0.1ml) in preventing hepatitis A. No significant systemic adverse events were reported. One trial showed that immunoglobulin was more effective than placebo for post-exposure prophylaxis. It appeared that there was no significant difference between immunoglobulins and inactivated hepatitis A vaccine in seroconversion to hepatitis A vaccine antibodies at four weeks (RR 1.16; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.38), but immunoglobulins were significantly less effective than vaccine regarding antibody levels at 8, 12, or 24 weeks. Authors' conclusions: Immunoglobulins seem to be effective for pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis of hepatitis A. However, caution is warranted for the positive findings due to the limited number of trials, year of conductance, and risk of bias. Conductance of rigorous trials will be justifiable.

N2  - Background: Human populations are structured by social networks, in which individuals tend to form relationships based on shared attributes. Certain attributes that are ambiguous, stigmatized or illegal can create a OhiddenO population, so-called because its members are difficult to identify. Many hidden populations are also at an elevated risk of exposure to infectious diseases. Consequently, public health agencies are presently adopting modern survey techniques that traverse social networks in hidden populations by soliciting individuals to recruit their peers, e.g., respondent-driven sampling (RDS). The concomitant accumulation of network-based epidemiological data, however, is rapidly outpacing the development of computational methods for analysis. Moreover, current analytical models rely on unrealistic assumptions, e.g., that the traversal of social networks can be modeled by a Markov chain rather than a branching process. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we develop a new methodology based on stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), which are well-suited to modeling tree-like structure of the RDS recruitment process. We apply this methodology to an RDS case study of injection drug users (IDUs) in Tijuana, Mexico, a hidden population at high risk of blood-borne and sexually-transmitted infections (i.e., HIV, hepatitis C virus, syphilis). Survey data were encoded as text strings that were parsed using our custom implementation of the inside-outside algorithm in a publicly-available software package (HyPhy), which uses either expectation maximization or direct optimization methods and permits constraints on model parameters for hypothesis testing. We identified significant latent variability in the recruitment process that violates assumptions of Markov chain-based methods for RDS analysis: firstly, IDUs tended to emulate the recruitment behavior of their own recruiter; and secondly, the recruitment of like peers (homophily) was dependent on the number of recruits. Conclusion(s): SCFGs provide a rich probabilistic language that can articulate complex latent structure in survey data derived from the traversal of social networks. Such structure that has no representation in Markov chain-based models can interfere with the estimation of the composition of hidden populations if left unaccounted for, raising critical implications for the prevention and control of infectious disease epidemics. © 2009 Poon et al.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The husbandry systems for laying hens were changed in Sweden during the years 2001 - 2004, and an increase in the number of submissions for necropsy from laying hen farms was noted. Hence, this study was initiated to compare causes of mortality in different housing systems for commercial laying hens during this change. METHOD(S): Based on results from routine necropsies of 914 laying hens performed at the National Veterinary Institute (SVA) in Uppsala, Sweden between 2001 and 2004, a retrospective study on the occurrence of diseases and cannibalism, i.e., pecking leading to mortality, in different housing systems was carried out. Using the number of disease outbreaks in caged flocks as the baseline, the expected number of flocks with a certain category of disease in the other housing systems was estimated having regard to the total number of birds in the population. Whether the actual number of flocks significantly exceeded the expected number was determined using a Poisson distribution for the variance of the baseline number, a continuity correction and the exact value for the Poisson distribution function in Excel 2000. RESULT(S): Common causes of mortality in necropsied laying hens included colibacillosis, erysipelas, coccidiosis, red mite infestation, lymphoid leukosis and cannibalism. Less common diagnoses were Newcastle Disease, pasteurellosis and botulism. Considering the size of the populations in the different housing systems, a larger proportion of laying hens than expected was submitted for necropsy from litter-based systems and free range production compared to hens in cages (P < 0.001). The study showed a significantly higher occurrence of bacterial and parasitic diseases and cannibalism in laying hens kept in litter-based housing systems and free-range systems than in hens kept in cages (P < 0.001). The occurrence of viral diseases was significantly higher in indoor litter-based housing systems than in cages (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): The results of the present study indicated that during 2001-2004 laying hens housed in litter-based housing systems, with or without access to outdoor areas, were at higher risk of infectious diseases and cannibalistic behaviour compared to laying hens in cages. Future research should focus on finding suitable prophylactic measures, including efficient biosecurity routines, to reduce the risk of infectious diseases and cannibalism in litter-based housing systems for laying hens.

N2  - As highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus continues to circulate in the world, poultry farm biosecurity and timely reporting of morbidity and mortality among commercial poultry farms in the United States are major concerns. To assess the vulnerability of poultry farms to the introduction and spread of a highly infectious pathogen, such as the currently circulating H5N1 influenza virus, a survey was administered to growers in two counties in Georgia representing areas of low and high poultry densities. Survey questions regarding horizontal contacts and management were sent to commercial broiler and breeder-layer chicken producers. Responses were used to estimate and compare contact rates and patterns between the two regions. The distribution of high-risk visitors (i.e., those going inside the poultry houses) to poultry farms did not vary significantly between growers in counties with high and low poultry densities or between breeder-layer and broiler growers. Compared with broiler producers in the county with high poultry density, broiler growers in the county with low poultry density were more likely to hire non-family employees to help with poultry management (62% vs. 17%; P = 0.001) and assist other growers with their poultry (31% vs. 6%; P = 0.025). Use of contracted litter services was significantly higher (P = 0.019) among broiler growers in the poultry-dense county (40%) compared with the low-density county (6%). Compared with broiler growers, breeder-layer producers also were significantly more likely to hire non-family employees to help on the farm (53% vs. 17%; P = 0.008). Poultry growers in the highly poultry-dense county were more likely to have a public road or field receiving poultry litter within a quarter mile of their poultry houses, compared with those in the lower density county. Data obtained in this study support the observations of published poultry disease outbreak investigations and highlight the differences in farm vulnerability to disease introduction within areas of different poultry densities and management practices.

N2  - A series of simulation experiments was conducted to determine how estimates of the latent and infectious periods, number of neighbours (contacts) and population size impact on the predicted magnitude and distribution of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks in white-tailed deer in southern Texas. Outbreaks were simulated using a previously developed and applied susceptible-latent-infected-recovered geographic automata model. There were substantial differences in the estimated predicted number of deer and locations infected, based on the model parameters used (3779-119 879 deer infected and 227-6526 locations affected). There were also substantial differences in the spatial risk of infection based on the model parameters used. The predicted spread of FMD was found to be most sensitive to the assumed latent period and the assumed number of contacts. How these parameters are estimated is likely to be critical in studies on the impact of FMD spread in situations in which wildlife reservoirs might potentially exist.

N2  - Post-transfusion hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection worldwide is considered a sporadic event. An outbreak of HAV infection occurred in Latvia between the end of 2007 and throughout 2008 with more than 2,800 confirmed cases reported over a 13-month period (incidence of 123 per 100,000 population). The majority of reported HAV infection cases were in people over 18 years of age and in people living in the capital city, Riga. We estimated that the crude risk for HAV contamination of whole blood supplies in Riga between February and October 2008 ranged from 1.4 to 10.6per 10,000 donated units. In people under 40 years of age, the risk of receiving an infectious blood transfusion was more than 3.0 per 10,000 recipients between August and October 2008 during the peak of the outbreak. We conclude that there is a previously under-recognised impact of HAV on blood safety during widespread outbreaks of this disease. Estimating the risk of contamination of blood supplies during an infectious disease outbreak scenario is important for fine tuning risk assessments and potentially improving public health practices.

N2  - Background: Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina are enteroviral infectious diseases caused mainly by Coxsackie virus A (CA) or enterovirus 71 (EV71). From 2000 to 2002, many complicated cases were reported in Japan, therefore a nationwide questionnaire survey was carried out to assess the situation. The subjects were patients with HFMD or herpangina, or other enterovirus infection from 2000 to 2002, who were either hospitalized over 24 h or who died. The response rates were 41.3% in 2000 and 2001 and 31.6% in 2002. The survey period included the year 2000, when HFMD epidemics due to EV71 occurred. To examine risk factors causing complications of enterovirus infection, severe cases of HFMD were focused on. Method(s): HFMD cases in 2000 were divided into two groups according to severity: 'more severe' and 'less severe'. 'More severe' was defined as 'fatal, involving sequelae, or involving hospitalization for 7 days or longer'. Statistical analyses were conducted with Epi info version 3.3 and the association between risk factors and severity was estimated. Result(s): The number of patients with more severe and less severe cases was 96 and 103, respectively. There was no difference in sex, age, having siblings and family history between the two groups. There was a significant association between attending child care center and severe HFMD. Conclusion(s): It is not clear why attending child care centers was associated with HFMD severity. Further study is needed. © 2010 Japan Pediatric Society.

N2  - Amphibian chytridiomycosis is a disease caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Whether Bd is a new emerging pathogen (the novel pathogen hypothesis; NPH) or whether environmental changes are exacerbating the host-pathogen dynamic (the endemic pathogen hypothesis; EPH) is debated. To disentangle these hypotheses we map the distribution of Bd and chytridiomycosis across the Iberian Peninsula centred on the first European outbreak site. We find that the infection-free state is the norm across both sample sites and individuals. To analyse this dataset, we use Bayesian zero-inflated binomial models to test whether environmental variables can account for heterogeneity in both the presence and prevalence of Bd, and heterogeneity in the occurrence of the disease, chytridiomycosis. We also search for signatures of Bd-spread within Iberia using genotyping. We show (1) no evidence for any relationship between the presence of Bd and environmental variables, (2) a weak relationship between environmental variables and the conditional prevalence of infection, (3) stage-dependent heterogeneity in the infection risk, (4) a strong association between altitude and chytridiomycosis, (5) multiple Iberian genotypes and (6) recent introduction and spread of a single genotype of Bd in the Pyrenees. We conclude that the NPH is consistent with the emergence of Bd in Iberia. However, epizootic forcing of infection is tied to location and shaped by both biotic and abiotic variables. Therefore, the population-level consequences of disease introduction are explained by EPH-like processes. This study demonstrates the power of combining surveillance and molecular data to ascertain the drivers of new emerging infections diseases. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.

N2  - Considerable attention has been given lately to the need for global systems for animal disease surveillance that support real-time assessment of changing temporal-spatial risks. Until recently, however, prospects for development of such systems have been limited by the lack of informatics tools and an overarching collaboration framework to enable real-time data capturing, sharing, analysis, and related decision-making. In this paper, we present some of the tools of the FMD BioPortal System (www.fmd.ucdavis.edu/bioportal), which is a web-based system that facilitates near real-time information sharing, visualization, and advanced space-time cluster analysis for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Using this system, FMD information that is collected and maintained at various data acquisition and management sites around the world can be submitted to a data repository using various mutually agreed upon Extensible Markup Language (XML) formats, including Health Level Seven (HL7). FMD BioPortal makes available a set of advanced space-time cluster analysis techniques, including scan statistic-based methods and machine learning-based clustering methods. These techniques are aimed at identifying local clusters of disease cases in relation to the background risk. Data and analysis results can be displayed using a novel visualization environment, which supports multiple views including GIS, timeline, and periodical patterns. All FMD BioPortal functionalities are accessible through the Web and data confidentiality can be secured through user access control and computer network security techniques such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). FMD BioPortal is currently operational with limited data routinely collected by the Office International des Epizooties, the GenBank, the FMD World Reference Laboratory in Pirbright, and by the FMD Laboratory at the University of California in Davis. Here we describe technical attributes and capabilities of FMD BioPortal and illustrate its functionality by analyzing and displaying information from a simulated FMD epidemic in California. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Chapter 30 Historical aspects of the major neurological vitamin deficiency disorders: the water-soluble B vitamins
T2  - Handbook of Clinical Neurology

N2  - This historical review addresses major neurological disorders associated with deficiencies of water-soluble B vitamins: beriberi, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, pellagra, neural tube defects, and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Beriberi: Beriberi was known for millennia in Asia, but was not described by a European until the 17th century when Brontius in the Dutch East Indies reported the progressive sensorimotor polyneuropathy. The prevalence of beriberi increased greatly in Asia with a change in the milling process for rice in the late 19th century. In the 1880s, Takaki demonstrated the benefits of dietary modification in sailors, and later instituted dietary reforms in the Japanese Navy, which largely eradicated beriberi from the Japanese Navy by 1887. In 1889 Eijkman in Java serendipitously identified dietary factors as a major contributor to "chicken polyneuritis," which he took to be an animal model for beriberi; the polyneuritis could be cured or prevented by feeding the chickens either unpolished rice or rice polishings. By 1901, Grijns, while continuing studies of beriberi in Java, suggested a dietary deficiency explanation for beriberi after systematically eliminating deficiencies of known dietary components and excluding a toxic effect. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome: In the late 1870s, Wernicke identified a clinicopathological condition with ophthalmoparesis, nystagmus, ataxia, and encephalopathy, associated with punctate hemorrhages symmetrically arranged in the grey matter around the third and fourth ventricles and the aqueduct of Sylvius. In the late 1880s, Korsakoff described a spectrum of cognitive disorders, including a confabulatory amnestic state following an agitated delirium, occurring in conjunction with peripheral polyneuropathy. Beginning around 1900, investigators recognized the close relationship between Korsakoff's psychosis, delirium tremens, and Wernicke's encephalopathy, but not until several decades later were Wernicke's encephalopathy, Korsakoff's psychosis, and beriberi all linked to the deficiency of a specific dietary factor, i.e. thiamin. Thiamin: Thiamin was crystallized from rice polishings by Jansen and Donath in 1926, and synthesized by Williams and Cline in 1936. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, characteristic pathological changes of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome were produced in animal models, the biochemical roles of thiamin in intermediary carbohydrate metabolism were elaborated by Peters and others, and the therapeutic benefits of thiamin for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and beriberi were demonstrated. By the 1950s synthetic forms of the vitamin were produced cheaply, allowing both therapeutic administration and prevention with food enrichment. Pellagra and niacin: Pellagra was unknown prior to the introduction of maize into Europe from the New World. In the 18th century, Casal and Frapolli described the clinical features of pellagra in Europe, and linked it with poverty and subsistence on nutritionally marginal corn-based diets. In the United States, pellagra became epidemic among poor Southerners in the early 20th century, in part because of economically-driven reliance on monotonous, nutritionally inadequate diets, combined with new manufacturing methods that removed vitamins from processed grain. From 1914-1929, Goldberger completed well-designed epidemiologic investigations, tested theories with human experiments, and utilized an animal model ("black tongue" in dogs) - all strongly supporting a dietary deficiency explanation for pellagra over prevailing toxic and infectious theories. Initial prevention and treatment approaches proved inadequate because of complex social issues linked to poverty, even after Goldberger and colleagues established that dried brewer's yeast could cure or prevent pellagra less expensively than dietary modification. During the depression, the collapse of cotton as an economically viable crop facilitated crop diversification, which contributed to an abrupt decline in pellagra mortality in the early 1930s. In 1937 Elvehjem isolated the P-P (pellagra preventive) factor, identified it as nicotinic acid (niacin), and demonstrated that nicotinic acid and nicotinic acid amide cure black tongue in dogs. Although clinical trials soon confirmed dramatic therapeutic effects in individual people, therapeutic administration of niacin had relatively little impact on population-level morbidity and mortality. Vitamin fortification of foodstuffs during World War II ultimately eradicated endemic pellagra in the United States. In the 1940s and 1950s, with expanded biochemical knowledge, pellagra was reformulated as a deficiency disease due to inadequate niacin and its amino acid precursor tryptophan. Neural tube defects and folate: Folate deficiency was initially recognized clinically as a macrocytic anemia in the 1920s, and only clearly separated from pernicious anemia by the mid-20th century. When folic acid was isolated and synthesized in the 1940s, it was shown to correct the macrocytic anemia associated with pernicious anemia, while the neurological manifestations progressed. In the 1950s and 1960s, the biochemical role of folates in transferring single carbon units was elucidated. Beginning in the 1960s, folate deficiency was increasingly recognized as the major cause of preventable neural tube defects. In the early 1990s well-designed randomized trials established that folate supplementation could prevent neural tube defects. Trial data, collectively indicating that periconceptual folate administration reduces both the occurrence and recurrence risks of neural tube defects by at least 70%, helped establish governmental recommendations concerning folic acid intake and health policy concerning vitamin fortification of foodstuffs. When dietary modification and supplementation strategies proved inadequate, folic acid food fortification was legally mandated in the US in the late 1990s, which significantly improved population folate status and produced an abrupt decline (20%-27%) in the prevalence of neural tube defects at birth. Recent studies have established genetic predispositions for neural tube defects, including both infant and maternal gene polymorphisms for enzymes involved in folate-dependent homocysteine metabolism, which help explain how the genotype of the mother, the genotype of the unborn child, and environmental factors (e.g. folate intake) can all impact on the risk of neural tube defects. Subacute combined degeneration and B12 deficiency: Pernicious anemia was recognized clinically in the mid-19th century by Addison, but the most important neurological manifestation - subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord - was not recognized clinically and linked with pernicious anemia until the end of the 19th century, particularly by Lichtheim, Putnam, and Dana. At the beginning of the 20th century, pernicious anemia and the associated subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord were considered, by many investigators, to result from infectious or toxic causes. During the first quarter of the 20th century, various therapies were employed, but, with the possible exception of transfusion, were largely ineffective. In the 1920s, Minot and Murphy showed that large quantities of ingested liver could be used to effectively treat pernicious anemia, and specifically could improve or prevent progression of neurological manifestations, and could extend life expectancy beyond 2 years. Beginning in the late 1920s, Castle demonstrated that a substance elaborated by the gastric mucosa ("intrinsic factor") was essential for the absorption of a dietary factor ("extrinsic factor," later shown to be vitamin B12) needed to prevent pernicious anemia. Over two decades, from the late 1920s until the late 1940s, increasingly potent liver extracts were manufactured that could be given either intramuscularly or intravenously. In 1947, vitamin B12 was isolated by Folkers and colleagues, and nearly simultaneously by Smith. Shortly thereafter the therapeutic efficacy of vitamin B12 on subacute combined degeneration was demonstrated by West and Reisner and others. By 1955, Hodgkin determined the molecular structure of cyanocobalamin using computer-assisted x-ray crystallography, allowing complete chemical synthesis of vitamin B12 in 1960 by an international consortium. Beginning in the late 1950s, the absorption and biochemistry of vitamin B12 were elaborated, and several lines of evidence converged to upport an autoimmune basis for pernicious anemia. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background. The spread of infectious disease is determined by biological factors, e.g. the duration of the infectious period, and social factors, e.g. the arrangement of potentially contagious contacts. Repetitiveness and clustering of contacts are known to be relevant factors influencing the transmission of droplet or contact transmitted diseases. However, we do not yet completely know under what conditions repetitiveness and clustering should be included for realistically modelling disease spread. Methods. We compare two different types of individual-based models: One assumes random mixing without repetition of contacts, whereas the other assumes that the same contacts repeat day-by-day. The latter exists in two variants, with and without clustering. We systematically test and compare how the total size of an outbreak differs between these model types depending on the key parameters transmission probability, number of contacts per day, duration of the infectious period, different levels of clustering and varying proportions of repetitive contacts. Results. The simulation runs under different parameter constellations provide the following results: The difference between both model types is highest for low numbers of contacts per day and low transmission probabilities. The number of contacts and the transmission probability have a higher influence on this difference than the duration of the infectious period. Even when only minor parts of the daily contacts are repetitive and clustered can there be relevant differences compared to a purely random mixing model. Conclusion. We show that random mixing models provide acceptable estimates of the total outbreak size if the number of contacts per day is high or if the per-contact transmission probability is high, as seen in typical childhood diseases such as measles. In the case of very short infectious periods, for instance, as in Norovirus, models assuming repeating contacts will also behave similarly as random mixing models. If the number of daily contacts or the transmission probability is low, as assumed for MRSA or Ebola, particular consideration should be given to the actual structure of potentially contagious contacts when designing the model. © 2009 Smieszek et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Emerging infectious diseases threaten wildlife populations and human health. Understanding the spatial distributions of these new diseases is important for disease management and policy makers; however, the data are complicated by heterogeneities across host classes, sampling variance, sampling biases, and the space-time epidemic process. Ignoring these issues can lead to false conclusions or obscure important patterns in the data, such as spatial variation in disease prevalence. Here, we applied hierarchical Bayesian disease mapping methods to account for risk factors and to estimate spatial and temporal patterns of infection by chronic wasting disease (CWD) in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) of Wisconsin, USA. We found significant heterogeneities for infection due to age, sex, and spatial location. Infection probability increased with age for all young deer, increased with age faster for young males, and then declined for some older animals, as expected from disease-associated mortality and age-related changes in infection risk. We found that disease prevalence was clustered in a central location, as expected under a simple spatial epidemic process where disease prevalence should increase with time and expand spatially. However, we could not detect any consistent temporal or spatiotemporal trends in CWD prevalence. Estimates of the temporal trend indicated that prevalence may have decreased or increased with nearly equal posterior probability, and the model without temporal or spatiotemporal effects was nearly equivalent to models with these effects based on deviance information criteria. For maximum interpretability of the role of location as a disease risk factor, we used the technique of direct standardization for prevalence mapping, which we develop and describe. These mapping results allow disease management actions to be employed with reference to the estimated spatial distribution of the disease and to those host classes most at risk. Future wildlife epidemiology studies should employ hierarchical Bayesian methods to smooth estimated quantities across space and time, account for heterogeneities, and then report disease rates based on an appropriate standardization. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.

T1  - Paradox of Vaccination: Is Vaccination really effective against avian flu epidemics?
A1  - Iwani S.
A1  - Suzuki T.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Background: Although vaccination can be a useful tool for control of avian influenza epidemics, it might engender emergence of a vaccine-resistant strain. Field and experimental studies show that some avian influenza strains acquire resistance ability against vaccination. We investigated, in the context of the emergence of a vaccine-resistant strain, whether a vaccination program can prevent the spread of infectious disease. We also investigated how losses from immunization by vaccination imposed by the resistant strain affect the spread of the disease. Methods and Findings: We designed and analyzed a deterministic compartment model illustrating transmission of vaccine-sensitive and vaccine-resistant strains during a vaccination program. We investigated how the loss of protection effectiveness impacts the program. Results show that a vaccination to prevent the spread of disease can instead spread the disease when the resistant strain is less virulent than the sensitive strain. If the loss is high, the program does not prevent the spread of the resistant strain despite a large prevalence rate of the program. The epidemic's final size can be larger than that before the vaccination program. We propose how to use poor vaccines, which have a large loss, to maximize program effects and describe various program risks, which can be estimated using available epidemiological data. Conclusion(s): We presented clear and simple concepts to elucidate vaccination program guidelines to avoid negative program effects. Using our theory, monitoring the virulence of the resistant strain and investigating the loss caused by the resistant strain better development of vaccination strategies is possible. © 2009 Iwami et al.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Bovine herpesvirus type-1 (BHV-1) is an important pathogen of cattle that presents with a variety of clinical signs, including the upper respiratory tract infection infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR). A seroepidemiological study of BHV-1 antibodies was conducted in England from 2002 - 2004: 29,782 blood samples were taken from 15,736 cattle from 114 herds which were visited on up to three occasions. Antibody concentration was measured using a commercial ELISA. Farm management information was collected using an interview questionnaire, and herd size and cattle movements were obtained from the cattle tuberculosis testing database and the British Cattle Movement Service. Hierarchical statistical models were used to investigate associations between cattle and herd variables and the continuous outcome percentage positive (PP) values from the ELISA test in unvaccinated herds. RESULT(S): There were 7 vaccinated herds, all with at least one seropositive bovine. In unvaccinated herds 83.2% had at least one BHV-1 seropositive bovine, and the mean cattle and herd BHV-1 seroprevalence were 42.5% and 43.1% respectively. There were positive associations between PP value, age, herd size, presence of dairy cattle. Adult cattle in herds with grower cattle had lower PP values than those in herds without grower cattle. Purchased cattle had significantly lower PP values than homebred cattle, whereas cattle in herds that were totally restocked after the foot-and-mouth epidemic in 2001 had significantly higher PP values than those in continuously stocked herds. Samples taken in spring and summer had significantly lower PP values than those taken in winter, whereas those taken in autumn had significantly higher PP values than those taken in winter. The risks estimated from a logistic regression model with a binary outcome (seropositive yes/no) were similar. CONCLUSION(S): The prevalence of BHV-1 seropositivity in cattle and herds has increased since the 1970s. Although the study population prevalence of BHV-1 was temporally stable during study period, the associations between serological status and cattle age, herd size, herd type, presence of young stock and restocked versus continuously stocked herds indicate that there is heterogeneity between herds and so potential for further spread of BHV-1 within and between herds.

N2  - Adenoviruses are associated with numerous disease outbreaks, particularly those involving d-cares, schools, children's camps, hospitals and other health care centers, and military settings. In addition, adenoviruses have been responsible for many recreational water outbreaks, including a greater number of swimming pool outbreaks than any other waterborne virus (Gerba and Enriquez 1997). Two drinking water outbreaks have been documented for adenovirus (Divizia et al. 2004; Kukkula et al. 1997) but none for food. Of the 51 known adenovirus serotypes, one third are associated with human disease, while other infections are asymptomatic. Human diseases associated with adenovirus infections include gastroenteritis, respiratory infections, eye infections, acute hemorrhagic cystitis, and meningoencephalitis (Table 2). Children and the immunocompromised are more severely impacted by adenovirus infections. Subsequently, adenovirus is included in the EPA's Drinking Water Contaminant Candidate List (CCL), which is a list of unregulated contaminants found in public water systems that may pose a risk to public health (National Research Council 1999). Adenoviruses have been detected in various waters worldwide including wastewater, river water, oceans, and swimming pools (Hurst et al. 1988; Irving and Smith 1981; Pina et al. 1998). Adenoviruses typically outnumber the enteroviruses, when both are detected in surface waters. Chapron et al. (2000) found that 38% of 29 surface water samples were positive for infectious Ad40 and Ad41. Data are lacking, Waterborne Adenovirus 159 regarding the occurrence of adenovirus in water in the US, particularly for groundwater and drinking water. Studies have shown, however, that adenoviruses survive longer in water than enteroviruses and hepatitis A virus (Enriquez et al. 1995), which may be due to their double-stranded DNA. Risk assessments have been conducted on waterborne adenovirus (Crabtree et al. 1997; van Heerden et al. 2005c). Using dose-response data for inhalation from Couch et al. (1966), human health risks of infection, illness and death have been determined for various adenovirus exposures. Crabtree et al. (1997) conclude that, even at an adenovirus concentration of 1 per 1,000 L of drinking water, annual risks of infection exceed the suggested risk recommendation of 1 x 10-4 per yr (Regli et al. 1991) (Table 8). Using the same exposure and dose-response assumptions, van Heerden et al. (2005c) determined annual risks of infection to be 1-1.7 x 10-1 for two drinking water samples from South Africa containing 1.40 and 2.45 adenoviruses per 10,000 L, respectively. This present study estimated annual risks of infection associated with varying levels of adenoviruses per 100 L (Table 9). By assuming a 2 L/d exposure and utilizing the exponential model at r = 0.4172 (Haas et al. 1993), yearly risks exceed the risk recommendation of 1 x 10-4 at every exposure level. There are limited data regarding the removal of adenoviruses by conventional water treatment or other physical-chemical treatment processes, but studies do suggest that adenoviruses are of equal or greater sensitivity to oxidizing disinfectants, when compared to other waterborne viruses (the most resistant to ultraviolet light). Data suggest that the chlorine doses applied to control other waterborne viruses are more effective against adenovirus, resulting in a greater than 4-log10 removal of adenoviruses by conventional treatment and chlorination. If treatment can achieve a 4-log10 removal of adenoviruses, then, based on the risk levels presented in Table 9, surface water concentrations should not exceed 0.5 adenoviruses per 100 L (Fig. 2). More data are needed regarding the occurrence of adenovirus in groundwater and drinking water, the effectiveness of water treatment against adenovirus, and the human-virus dose-response relationship to fully understand the role of adenovirus as a waterborne public health threat. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2008.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Acute bovine respiratory disease (ABRD) is a respiratory syndrome caused by various infectious agents, and represents a major economic and health problem in cattle herds worldwide. The aim of the study was to present how we can describe the epidemiological characteristics of ABRD in France, including risk factor analysis and spatio-temporal pattern investigation. The data were collected by specialized surveyors during the 2001 animal survey conducted by the French Ministry for Agriculture and Fisheries, from a representative sample of cattle herds. The health questionnaire concerned farm characteristics, practice of BRD vaccination, presence of ABRD, time of occurrence and number of affected animals for the period November 2000-October 2001. After a descriptive analysis of the syndrome, a space-time scan statistic was performed to detect potential clusters, and a logistic regression model was used for analysis of risk factors. The study sample included 16,581 cattle herds as representative of the 260,000 French herds. The ABRD cumulative incidence at farm level was 9.8%, the cumulative incidence at animal level was 2.1%, the cumulative mortality 0.1% and the lethality proportion 6.5%. ABRD occurred mainly during cold months with an epidemic peak in December. Spatial repartition of the syndrome showed that the whole territory was affected, with a higher number of cases in the north-east region, the main bovine production area in France. Three space-time clusters were identified in the period November 2000-February 2001. ABRD was significantly associated with production type, herd size, and BRD vaccination. Beef herds were less affected than dairy herds, and increased herd size increased the risk of ABRD. The outbreak was clustered in space and time, suggesting a common infectious agent for the epidemic in the detected areas. The influence of production type and herd size on syndrome occurrence highlighted the importance of management practices, human movement and animal density. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: A high rate of post-infectious fatigue and abdominal symptoms two years after a waterborne outbreak of giardiasis in Bergen, Norway in 2004 has previously been reported. The aim of this report was to identify risk factors associated with such manifestations. Method(s): All laboratory confirmed cases of giardiasis (n = 1262) during the outbreak in Bergen in 2004 received a postal questionnaire two years after. Degree of post-infectious abdominal symptoms and fatigue, as well as previous abdominal problems, was recorded. In the statistical analyses number of treatment courses, treatment refractory infection, delayed education and sick leave were used as indices of protracted and severe Giardia infection. Age, gender, previous abdominal problems and symptoms during infection were also analysed as possible risk factors. Simple and multiple ordinal logistic regression models were used for the analyses. Result(s): The response rate was 81% (1017/1262), 64% were women and median age was 31 years (range 3-93), compared to 61% women and 30 years (range 2-93) among all 1262 cases. Factors in multiple regression analysis significantly associated with abdominal symptoms two years after infection were: More than one treatment course, treatment refractory infection, delayed education, bloating and female gender. Abdominal problems prior to Giardia infection were not associated with post-infectious abdominal symptoms. More than one treatment course, delayed education, sick leave more than 2 weeks, and malaise at the time of infection, were significantly associated with fatigue in the multiple regression analysis, as were increasing age and previous abdominal problems. Conclusion(s): Protracted and severe giardiasis seemed to be a risk factor for post-infectious fatigue and abdominal symptoms two years after clearing the Giardia infection. © 2009 Morch et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - In recent years, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses have caused the death of millions of poultry and of more than 200 humans worldwide. A proper understanding of the transmission dynamics and risk factors for epidemic spread of these viruses is key to devising effective control strategies. The aim of this study was to quantify the epidemiological contributions of backyard flocks using data from the H7N7 HPAI epidemic in the Netherlands in 2003. A dataset was constructed in which flocks in the affected area were classified as susceptible (S), infected but not yet infectious (E), infectious (I), and removed (R). The analyses were based on a two-type SEIR epidemic model, with the two types representing commercial poultry farms and backyard poultry flocks. The analyses were aimed at estimation of the susceptibility (g) and infectiousness (f) of backyard flocks relative to commercial farms. The results show that backyard flocks were considerably less susceptible to infection than commercial farms (over(g, ) = 0.014 ; 95 % CI = 0.0071 - 0.023), while estimates of the relative infectiousness of backyard flocks varied widely (0 <= over(f, ) <= 5). Our results indicate that, from an epidemiological perspective, backyard flocks played a marginal role in the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the Netherlands in 2003. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - To optimize control of an avian influenza outbreak knowledge of within-flock transmission is needed. This study used field data to estimate the transmission rate parameter (beta) and the influence of risk factors on within-flock transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N7 virus in the 2003 epidemic in The Netherlands. The estimation is based on back-calculation of daily mortality data to fit a susceptible-infectious-dead format, and these data were analysed with a generalized linear model. This back-calculation method took into account the uncertainty of the length of the latent period, the survival of an infection by some birds and the influence of farm characteristics. After analysing the fit of the different databases created by back-calculation, it could be concluded that an absence of the latency period provided the best fit. The transmission rate parameter (beta) from these field data was estimated at 4.50 per infectious chicken per day (95% CI: 2.68-7.57), which was lower than what was reported from experimental data. In contrast to general belief, none of the studied risk factors (housing system, flock size, species, age of the birds in weeks and date of depopulation) had significant influence on the estimated beta. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The placement of sentinel birds in a commercial poultry flock infected with low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) may be an effective way of detecting subsequent change in the isolate to a high pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV). Data collected from the 2002 Chilean HPAIV outbreak, along with information from a literature review of laboratory studies involving A/chicken/Chile/176822/02 (H7N3/LP) and A/chicken/Chile/184240-1/02 (H7N3/HP) viruses, were used to construct a computer simulation model. Mortality rates of the original LPAIV-infected population and the sentinel population were compared to detect the presence of HPAIV. A total of 12 increased mortality threshold scenarios were examined, using one-day absolute (2, 3, or 4 birds) or relative (0.5, 1.0, or 1.5%) mortality thresholds, and two-day absolute (1, 2, or 3 birds) or relative (0.25, 0.50, or 1.00%) mortality thresholds, to indicate the change from LPAIV to HPAIV in the sentinel and original populations, respectively. Results showed that following a one-day approach, threshold mortalities occurred on average at 7.35, 7.82, and 8.17 (0.5, 1.0, or 1.5%) and 6.21, 6.38, and 6.45 (2, 3, or 4 birds) days after the first infectious case for the original and sentinel populations, respectively. The two-day approach delayed the occurrence of threshold mortalities, on average, to 7.64, 8.05, and 8.62 (0.25, 0.50, or 1.00%) and 6.86, 6.78, and 7.23 (1, 2, or 3 birds) days after the first infectious case for the original and sentinel populations, respectively. Although, significant (p < 0.10) differences were observed among different combinations of detection times for the original and sentinel populations, the use of sentinel birds has a maximum mean advantage, over monitoring mortality exclusively in the original population, of 1.96 and 1.84 days for one- and two-day threshold moralities, respectively. Additionally, the early warning system based on a sentinel vs. original population presented a decrease of the probabilities of a false alarm, from 0.04-0.45 to <0.01-0.10%. These findings may be used by decision makers to evaluate the risk of not depopulating a flock infected with a H5 or H7 LPAIV strain and the benefit of using sentinel birds as an early warning system of a change to HPAIV. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - A large number (n=591) of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) outbreaks have been reported in wild birds of Europe from October 2005 through January 2009. Consequently, prevention and control strategies have been implemented in response to the outbreaks and considerable discussion has taken place regarding the need for implementing surveillance programs in high-risk areas with the objective of early detecting and preventing HPAIV epidemics. However countries ability to define the temporal and spatial extension of the high risk areas has been impaired by the lack of information on the distribution of susceptible wild bird populations in the region. Here, a technique for the detection of time-space disease clustering that does not require information on the distribution of susceptible populations and that has been referred to as the time-space permutation model of the scan statistic was used to identify areas and times of the year in which epidemics of H5N1 HPAIV were most likely to occur in wild bird populations of Europe from October, 2005, through December, 2008. The scan statistic was parameterized considering pre-existing knowledge on the epidemiological and ecological characteristics of the disease in the region. Robustness of the results was assessed using a generalized linear regression model to compare the outcomes of 36 alternative parameterizations of the scan statistic. Ten significant time-space clusters of H5N1 HPAI outbreaks were detected in six European countries. Results were sensitive (P<0.05) to the definition of the maximum spatial size defined for the clusters. Results presented here will help to identify high risk areas for HPAIV surveillance in the European Union. Assumptions, results, and implications of the analytical model are extensively presented and discussed in order to facilitate the use of this approach for the identification of high risk areas for infectious animal disease surveillance in the absence of population data. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses show different disease dynamics between virus strains and host species, and therefore epidemic field data are very valuable. This study used field data of the HPAI H7N1 epidemic which affected Northern Italy in 1999-2000. Field mortality data was back-calculated into a S-I-format to estimate the transmission rate parameter beta, indicating the number of birds infected per infectious bird per time unit. The bird-infectious period was assumed to be 2 days, and all birds were assumed to die after this infectious period. The estimated beta for HPAI H7N1 virus transmission in turkeys was 1.43 (95% CI: 1.17-1.74). Farm risk factors such as flock size and age of the turkeys did not influence the estimated transmission rate parameter. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Exotic species can have devastating effects on recipient environments and even lead to the outbreak of emergent diseases. We present here several hidden effects that the introduction of goats has had on the Lesser Short-toed Lark, Calandrella rufescens, the commonest native bird inhabiting the island of Fuerteventura (Canary Islands). Vegetation structure varied with grazing pressure, and indeed, vegetation was all but eradicated from the locality with greatest goat densities, which was also where the lowest density of Lesser Shorttoed Larks was recorded. The impact of habitat impoverishment, however, was partially compensated for by changes in the foraging behavior of birds, which benefited from the abundant food provided to goats on farms. Capture-resighting methods showed that birds visiting farms outnumbered the estimates for birds obtained in the surrounding natural habitat, suggesting that there was recruitment from a much larger area. Stable isotope analyses of feathers indicated that island birds feed largely on the maize supplied at goat farms, showing poorer body condition than birds from populations not associated with farms (peninsular Spain and Morocco). Moreover, larks from Fuerteventura had a very high prevalence of poxvirus lesions compared with other bird populations worldwide and may increase the risk of contracting the disease by feeding on farms, where they aggregate and coexist atypically with domestic birds. The island birds also had lower average productivity, which may be the consequence of the emergent disease and/or the poor nutritional state resulting from feeding on a low-protein diet. Diseased and non-diseased birds from Fuerteventura showed similar body condition and annual survival rates. However, the isotopic traces of delta13C indicate that the diet of diseased birds was more uniform than that of non-diseased birds, being based on food from goat farms. Our results show how the combination of species frequently introduced onto islands (goats, poultry, and associated pathogens) can create ecological traps for native species that are not always easy to identify. Moreover, we stress that nutrition and infectious diseases are important determinants of the well-being and dynamics of animal populations, and thus health research must be included in the design of monitoring programs and conservation strategies. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.

N2  - Background: The emergency department (ED) is a crucial resource in the detection of infectious disease and instances of bioterrorism. Fever, defined as body temperature (temp) >=100.4degreeF, is an objective piece of data that can be used in the screening process for new fever outbreaks. To our knowledge there is currently no real time collection of fever events. Objective(s): To determine if real-time surveillance in an urban ED can lead to detection of a fever spike as defined a priori as a 3 fold increase in patients coming to the ED with a fever. Method(s): Temp monitoring was initiated in an urban ED for triage vital signs from 9/4/09 to 11/27/09 using Exergen temporal artery thermometers with automated data acquisition modules. Fever incidence as a percentage of total temps measured was compared to influenza-like illness (ILI) as a percentage of outpatient visits recorded weekly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Means are reported with 95% confidence intervals. Binomial distribution modeling of the amount of data needed to detect the start of an epidemic-like event was conducted. Result(s): 6131 temps were recorded with mean 98.19degreeF (95%CI +/- 2.4degreeF) which included 248 fevers. The temps were normal in distribution. A maximum of 13% of temps were recorded as fever in one day with an average of 6% fevers across the peak week. This was consistent with the spike in %ILI seen by the CDC due to H1N1. Initial statistical modeling shows that an increase of fever incidence to 3% from a 1% baseline indicates a febrile outbreak. A fever spike can be detected with 80% probability in 81 hours (assuming 120 temps/day) in one urban ED. If 10 similar urban EDs are used, assuming similar patient populations, the temp spike can be detected within 8.1 hours. Conclusion(s): Real-time automated body temp surveillance can be used in the ED to detect an increase in fever incidence. Preliminary modeling suggests that multi-site real-time temp data collection and reporting could lead to early detection of a fever event in the community.

N2  - Knowing which groups are most at risk from an emerging infectious disease is crucial in deciding the optimal allocation of resources during an outbreak response. The case fatality ratio is the fraction of cases who die after contracting a disease. Incomplete reporting of the number of infected individuals, both recovered and dead, can lead to biased estimates of the case fatality ratio. We propose an stimator for the relative case fatality ratio that is asymptotically unbiased and controls for reporting rates that may vary across time. We generalize our methods to account for elapsed time between infection and death. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of our methods in realistic outbreak scenarios. Our new methods could provide valuable information to identify vulnerable subpopulations early in an outbreak of an emerging pathogen such as pandemic H1N1 influenza.

N2  - In infectious disease epidemiology, we have traditionally used attack, incidence or hazard rate data from close contact settings to estimate transmissibility of acute infectious agents. These measures of risk implicitly assume that exposure to infection does not vary between individuals who are similar in regards to measured risk factors. This implicit assumption is typically incorrect when considering infectious diseases, which depend upon contact between individuals (an infectious contact) for transmission. Multiple statistical methods exist which relax the assumption of invariant exposure to infection, but they have yet to make it into mainstream use within infectious disease epidemiology. These methods estimate some form of the probability of infection per infectious contact. Migration of these methods into mainstream use has been stalled, in part, by the need to collect important exposure data. Here, we will briefly describe several of these methods, the types of additional data needed, and a computational tool for their implementation. We will illustrate these methods through an analysis of the transmission of pandemic H1N1 in an outbreak in Washington State. Using these methods, we estimate the transmissibility of the virus within different groups of individuals and the role of age in transmission.

N2  - RATIONALE Recent outbreaks of airborne infectious disease have urged characterization of human respiratory aerosols. We report a new application of laser diffraction technique to assess number and sizes of human respiratory aerosols. This technique provides a new method to improve models for assessing respiratory aerosols and associated exposure risks of infection during a pandemic outbreak. High resolution particle size volume distribution information, not available by other methods, can be incorporated in models that will more accurately predict human respiratory aerosol behaviours. Such models may also give insights to the effects of parameters such as particle size, volume and number concentration, exposure time, absolute humidity and individual lung health conditions on human respiratory aerosol generation. Laser diffraction also provides a novel way of measuring the mass of particles passing through the measurement zone. METHODS Healthy individuals consented to perform a series of respiratory maneuvers in open bench configuration. Measurements were done < 15 millimetres from the mouth/nose opening, collecting data every 0.4 milliseconds, using a laser diffractometer. Particle size distributions were calculated using Lorenz- Mie theory assuming optical properties of respiratory aerosols to be same as water. Aerosol volume concentrations were estimated from Beer-Lambert Law. Mass of expelled particles was derived from the aerosol volume concentration. Number of respiratory particles expelled into the measurement volume was calculated by combining aerosol size volume distribution and volume concentration. This study was approved by the University of Alberta Health Research Ethics Board. RESULTS We report data of three respiratory maneuvers from two representative participants. Table 1. Number (N) of respiratory particles per cm^3 expelled into the measurement volume during breathing, speaking and coughing (Table Presented) CONCLUSIONS The use of laser diffraction technique for rapid, real-time and high resolution measurement allows us to acquire comprehensive data on particle size volume distribution ranging from 0.1mum to 900 mum diameter during different respiratory maneuvers. These results demonstrate high sensitivity at low volume concentration, particularly for ultrafine particles (< 2.5mum). Analysis of data showed the number of particles <0.5 mum expelled during coughing was approximately ten times more than either breathing or speaking. This confirms coughing as the dominant means for the spread of airborne disease transmission.

N2  - Background: In light of the media coverage concerning recent infectious disease outbreaks such as the ongoing influenza pandemic as well as previous ones involving Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the public domain has become more conscience of infectious diseases as well as the effect of travel aiding their spread. Meningococcal meningitis has been a disease which among other factors such as age, climate and life style, is facilitated by travel. The causative bacterial agent, Neisseria meningitidis, being spread through aerosol respiratory droplets can cause Invasive Meningococcal Disease (IMD), and is a widely distributed, complex human disease affecting all age categories. Forecasting models exist for diseases based on vector-borne or wind related movement, as well as climate derived assessments, and recently travel oriented detection. Hence a combination of several factors ranging from meteorological to molecular level information should aid in determining likely occurrences of meningococcal meningitis epidemics in spatial and temporal means. Method(s): A systematic review was conducted in order to identify the different risks and models available in terms of IMD spread. Varying risk stratification was used to classify risk factors such as: travel related spread, respiratory co-infections, the effect of new meningococcal clones into a susceptible population, low humidity, high temperatures and lifestyle based aspects. These data will be used to create an early warning system generated through various technologies and transmission models in order to highlight risk areas and periods of ongoing IMD. Result(s): As other studies have shown, travel patterns such as destination, duration and timing during the year affect risk of IMD development and spread among travelers, whilst climate, geography and factors such as virulence of circulating strain are more important in determining the severity of an outbreak in terms of local occurrence and potential epidemic developments. Conclusion(s): Meningococcal meningitis is not only a well established threat in terms of epidemic or endemic occurrences, but also for travelers. Hence the development of more accurate and timely detection and forecasting methods are required to help in decision making processes involving prevention and early warning purposes.

N2  - Background: Rabies causes 55,000 deaths annually, half of which are in children less than 15 years of age, and has the highest mortality rate of any infectious disease. It is both preventable and controllable. Economic impact of rabies in developing countries in Asia and Africa, where over 98% of all human rabies deaths occur from exposure to canine rabies, rises each year. Estimated annual human rabies prevention costs are about $800 million U.S. Even so, continuing vaccine and RIG shortages in countries with the highest incidence of rabies continue unabated, leaving the most vulnerable at greatest risk. New lyssavirus genotypes continue to be discovered in bats in Asia and Africa-needing continuing widespread surveillance globally. Burden of disease and suffering cannot be over-stated. Rabies victims in developing countries are often sent home to die, due to lack of treatment facilities and fear of the disease. Additionally, lack of surveillance and adequate control measures have enabled rabies spread to previously rabies-free areas (e.g recent outbreak in Bali leading to human rabies deaths). Method(s): Literature review-MesH rabies, monoclonals, vaccine, epidemiology, surveillance Meeting abstracts 2008- 09. Result(s): Recent advances in rabies prevention and control strategies: 1. New vaccine both for humans and animals. Molecular biology has brought new understanding to lyssavirus evolution, to possible new reduced vaccine schedules, and to an effective substitute for equine or human rabies immunoglobulin through the development of promising monoclonal antibodies now in clinical trials. Oral animal vaccines have been developed using human adenovirus as the rabies G-Protein carrier. 2. Diagnosis of rabies in the field has been made posible via the dRIT light microscope immunohistochemical test. 3. GIS systems and computer modeling have improved rabies surveillance. 4.Partners for Rabies Control has developed an action blueprint for controlling rabies in developing countries. 5. Substantial funding from Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is targeted to studues if dog rabies elimination in Tanzania,Kuazulu-Natal, and the Philippines. 6. A registered charity in the U.K. and U.S., the Alliance for Rabies Control, has become a beacon for rabies education and prevention. Conclusion(s): Rabies is both preventable and controllablemany challenges, but brighter future!

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Infectious diseases spread through social contacts and affect people of all age groups. Traditional epidemic models consider these effects with the use of differential equations, contact networks or explicit modelling of households and workplaces. However past modelling studies did not implement structures of the health service system, like service providers (e.g. physicians) and their reimbursement. Therefore we investigate the integration of an epidemic contact model for infl uenza into a framework for modelling treatment pathways and reimbursement of service providers. METHOD(S): The model framework is of object-oriented and agent based type. It incorporates patients and providers as spatially distributed agents. When patients develop diseases they search for service providers and treatment through a central health market, which in general returns one of the nearest providers of requested type. Each disease is connected to the possible treatment pathways and health services that a patient with the specific disease will go through. In the study we incorporate infl uenza epidemics occurring at specified time intervals. These epidemics spread through contacts of the agents modelled by a small-world network. Patients get immune after recovering and therefore one epidemic cannot infect them twice. The model calculates reimbursement from consumed health provider services and drugs. RESULT(S): Modeled epidemics show the well-known behaviour of SIR-type models. Reduced capacity of service providers provokes that many patients do not consult them due to queuing effects. The model maps the development of costs over time plausibly. Different prescription probabilities of neuraminidase inhibitors infl uence the course of the epidemic only marginally. CONCLUSION(S): The integration of epidemic models with models of health service processes and reimbursement can lead toward a broader understanding of the infl uence of epidemics on health care systems. It is possible to investigate feedback of health service structure changes and reimbursement decisions on prevalence and effects of infectious diseases.

N2  - Purpose: Worldwide, 160,000 children are diagnosed with cancer each year; an incidence of 14.9 cases per 100,000 children less than 20 years of age. Over 80% of children with cancer live in developing countries. Method(s): A staggering 430,000 new cases of HIV/AIDS occur in children under 15 years of age worldwide each year. The classification of pediatric AIDS lists primary brain lymphomas, small non-cleaved cell non Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), immunoblastic or large cell lymphoma of B-cell or unknown immunologic phenotype, as well as Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) as AIDS-defining events, while leiomyosarcomas are included as a sign of a moderately symptomatic stage. Result(s): According to the National Cancer Institute, people infected with HIV are about 800 times more likely than uninfected people to be diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma, at least 7 times more likely to be diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and, among women, at least 3 times more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer. However, there might be age-related and regional differences. A study from Malawi showed marked differences in the seroprevalence of HIV infection associated with cancer in the pediatric population. The seroprevalence was 93% for children with Kaposi sarcoma, 4% for those with Burkitt lymphoma, but 31% for those with other non-Hodgkin lymphomas, 7% (1/15) for those with Hodgkin disease, and 5% (5/103) for those with other cancers. In sub-Saharan Africa, where Human Herpesvirus-8 is already endemic in many countries, the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma has risen dramatically in the HIV-era overtaking NHL in some HIV-positive cohorts. Unlike NHL it is almost completely preventable through the use of antiretroviral therapy. In a study from Zimbabwe, KS comprised 10.3% of all childhood tumors. While previously considered to be a symptom of end-stage HIV infection with minimal or no chance for cure (due to concurrent organ compromise), it is now clear that many of these malignancies can be approached with a curative intent, as long as HIV infection can be controlled. Conclusion(s): Mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection continues to account for a substantial, although decreasing, portion of new HIV infections in many African countries. Inadequate knowledge about the availability of prevention services in antenatal settings often impedes their uptake. In Sub-Saharan Africa alone, an estimated 390,000 [210,000-570,000] children are infected with the AIDS virus, placing those that survive at an increased risk of cancer. Many of these countries are poorly resourced to deal with the problem of childhood cancer. The unique endemic and epidemic distribution of infectious diseases makes the recognition, diagnosis and treatment of childhood cancer a challenge. In the absence of accurate populationbased registries, health workers in these countries are struggling to adequately assess the impact of their growing cancer problem on their countries' burgeoning populations.

N2  - Background and Aim: Acute gastroenteritis has been suggested to increase subsequent risk of IBD. In May 2000, contamination of municipal water by E. coli 0157:H7 and Campylobacter species caused a large outbreak of acute gastroenteritis (GE) in Walkerton, Ontario. The Walkerton Health Study (WHS) was initiated to study related long-term health outcomes including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Previous genetic analyses of this well-defined cohort have associated post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) in this cohort with defects in innate immunity and barrier function. Method(s): WHS participants were asked about diagnoses of IBD during standardized annual interviews from 2002 to 2008. Primary care physicians were also contacted to identify subjects with IBD and provide supporting medical records. An independent adjudication committee confirmed the timing and details of each diagnosis. Prevalence of IBD was assessed among subjects who resided in the Walkerton postal code during the outbreak. Incidence was assessed in a cohort of Walkerton residents with no prior diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). Result(s): Among 3047 eligible WHS participants (54.7% female; mean age 36.8+/-22.6), 16 cases of IBD were confirmed on review of records (9 CD, 6 UC and 1 indeterminate colitis). No records were available to confirm or refute an additional 41 self-reported diagnoses. Under the conservative assumption that non-participants did not have IBD, the estimated crude prevalence of confirmed IBD in Walkerton was 525.1/105 (295.4/105 for CD vs. 196.9/105 for UC). Excluding diagnoses made before the outbreak or in the first year of follow-up, the annual incidence of IBD among 2031 subjects with GE during the outbreak was 49.2/ 105 vs. 14.5/105 among 983 subjects who remained well (incidence rate ratio 3.39; 95% CI 0.21, 13.81). The incidence of CD among subjects with GE was 35.2/105, while that for UC was 7.0/105. Estimates of prevalence and incidence of CD exceed published Canadian population-based rates1 (233.7/105 and 13.4/105 respectively). Conclusion(s): The overall prevalence and incidence of CD in Walkerton is elevated. Although there is a trend to an increased incidence of IBD among residents who suffered acute GE during the outbreak, it is not statistically significant.

N2  - Some of the most important infectious processes in rabbits are primary treated with beta-lactamic drugs, but the potential risk of diarrhea and enteritis outbreak limits its therapeutic use. Very few drugs are licensed for use in this species as an alternative to beta-lactamics, leading to extra-label use of drug approved for other species. In this scenario, cefovecin (a third generation cephalosporin developed by Pfizer Animal Health as an aqueous solution for subcutaneous administration in dogs and cats) could be a possible candidate to solve the rabbit chemotherapy problem. Activity in vitro for the drug against all major bacterial pathogens in pets has been demonstrated, and its pharmacokinetic behavior has been characterized by a long elimination half-life and an extended activity in transudate making it suitable for a 14-days dosing (8 mg/kg) interval treatments. In the present work, a two-phase cross-over study was performed to know the kinetic behavior of cefovecin in rabbits. Ten clinically healthy White New Zealand rabbits were randomly distributed in two experimental groups; animals received 8 mg/kg body weight of cefovecin (Convenia) by intravenous or by subcutaneous injection. Serial blood samples (0.5 ml) were collected into lithium heparin tubes from the right marginal ear vein. Plasma concentrations of cefovecin were measured using a validated HPLC method and data were fitted to noncompartmental models to estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters. The calculated plasma half-life for cefovecin was about 1 h after intravenous and 3.5 h after subcutaneous administrations; a rapid clearance (4.33 ml/min/kg) and a low distribution volume (0.257 l/kg) characterize the kinetic behavior of the drug. The maximum mean plasma concentration (26.89 mug/ml) after subcutaneous administration was attained by 30 min, and bioavailability resulted in 91.2%. The plasma clearance of cefovecin (4.33 ml/min/kg) is according to a physiological glomerular filtration rate (4 ml/min/kg), suggesting that active re-absorption in the renal tubules or other mechanisms are not implicated in the elimination of the drug. The pharmacokinetic profile observed for cefovecin in rabbits show large dissimilarities compared to those previously published for dogs and cats and for hens and green iguanas. Plasma half-lives for pets resulted considerably longer than in rabbits, possibly due to a much slower clearance reported for these species (0.35 for dogs and 0.76 ml/h/kg for cats) vs 260 ml/h/kg in the present study. Nevertheless, the half-lives for rabbits resulted longer than those reported in hens (0.87 h) and similar to those published in iguanas (3.9 h).

N2  - Background: During the spring of 2009, the novel swine-origin infl uenza A (pandemic (H1N1) 2009) virus emerged and spread globally. It also spread nationwide in Japan. Although no established cases of transfusion-transmitted infl uenza had been reported, the widespread outbreak of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 caused great concern regarding the safety of blood products. The Japanese Red Cross Blood Centers have intercepted blood products with accompanying postdonation information indicating possible pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection. To study the risk of transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 by blood transfusion, we searched for the viral genome in those products using nucleic acid amplifi cation technology (NAT). Method(s): Between June and December 2009, blood products were collected from 579 blood donors who were diagnosed as having or strongly suspected to have pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection within seven days after donation. Five hundred and sixty-five plasma and 413 erythrocyte products from the 579 blood donors were available. Viral RNA was extracted from the plasma and erythrocyte products using a QIAamp Virus Biorobot MDx kit (QIAGEN, Maryland, USA) and a High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Large Volume kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA), respectively. Real-time RT-PCR designed in the hemagglutinin gene of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus and the matrix genes of universal infl uenza A viruses was carried out in accordance with the protocols developed by the Japanese National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID). Either 200 muL of a plasma sample or 100 muL of packed erythrocytes was used for each test, and the test was performed in duplicate for each gene in each sample. The sensitivity of the NAT was evaluated by spiking experiments using pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus particles contained in culture supernatant, donated by NIID. The viral genome copy numbers in the culture supernatant were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. The 95 % detection limits of the NAT were calculated as 283 genome equivalents/ mL in plasma and 3,444 genome equivalents/mL in packed erythrocytes. Result(s): Viral RNA of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was not detected in any blood samples from the 579 blood donors who had symptoms of infl uenza within seven days after donation. For 321 (55.4%) blood donors, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was diagnosed within three days postdonation. Just as it had been reported that the majority of patients with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were children and young people, 353 (61.0%) of the blood donors involved in this study were less than 30 years of age. Conclusion(s): The viremia of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was not demonstrated in 579 blood donors who had probably donated blood during the incubation period. It is considered that the risk of transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 by blood transfusion is extremely low.

N2  - The first case of BSE diagnosed in Canada in 1993 was imported from the UK. Since then a total of 18 cases have been diagnosed. Canada imported cattle from the UK and other countries in the period when BSE infection risk was high in those countries. We developed a mathematical model to estimate the actual number of infected animals. The model simulates the amount of imported infectivity and its recycling and propagation through rendering and feeding processes, and utilizes a probability mass function to estimate the number of animals infected due to consumption of infectious feeding units. We created a set of scenarios of the size of infectious units, rendering standards, and various rates of feed compliance. The results showed that the number of infected animals was higher than the number reported, and some of those infected were slaughtered for human consumption. The curve of the time course of the infection epidemic showed that infectivity started to propagate in the cattle feeding system in the late 80s and increased steadily even after the 1997 ruminant-to-ruminant feed ban. After 2003, the year when the EU rendering standards were implemented in Canada, infectivity started to decline rapidly, and reached zero levels after the implementation of the enhanced fed ban in 2007. In conclusion, BSE epidemic is vanishing in Canada due to implementation of effective feeding and rendering measures. The 1997 feed ban was somewhat inefficient, and infections after the ban were caused by cross-contamination.

N2  - The early days of the AIDS epidemic brought tragic consequences for blood recipients but also brought attention and resources to the prevention of transmission of infectious agents by transfusion of blood. Sensitive and specific assays discussed in the two other presentations of this session are the most effective "layer of safety"for the selection of safe donors. While regulatory oversight assures compliance with regulations and good manufacturing practices, history questions have lower sensitivity and poor predictive value (e.g. history of travel or hepatitis) and deferral files have a minor role in an age of computers and reproducible tests. Thus, test selection deserves attention from those involved in the preparation of blood for transfusion. Despite public demand for unattainable "zero risk", investments in transfusion safety also need to be balanced with other healthcare priorities appropriate for each environment. Different technologies address different issues. Serological assays detect antibodies against the infectious agent (signal amplification results from the immune response) while molecular assays detect the nucleic acid sequences, RNA or DNA through amplification that takes place in the test tube. Serological assays are effective for detection of antibodies in infected individuals in a population, or prevalent cases. Molecular assays (nucleic acid amplification tests or NAT) are effective for the detection of recent infections, or incident cases. Improvements in technology have brought sensitivity of 4th generation serological assays closer to that of NAT. In some instances, like detection of parasitic infections, serological tests are more effective because the few parasites present in a component may be sufficient to transmit infection but may be missed in the small specimen used for testing (Poisson distribution). Test selection must also consider regional epidemiology. Screening for hepatitis B (HBV) in a low prevalence area may be based on a combination of assays that include HBV surface antigen or HBsAg, antibodies to core of HBV (HBcAb) and NAT for HBV, depending on availability and resources. Selection is more difficult in high prevalence areas because a large segment of the population has been exposed to HBV and is positive for HBcAb, and often resources for the implementation of NAT are not available; thus, screening must rely on high sensitivity HBsAg assays. Regional epidemiology has also been a factor in the selective approach chosen for T. cruzi in the U.S. and HTLV-I/II in Europe. Serological assays are not effective for Dengue, West Nile Virus and probably other arboviruses because they are only transmitted when there is viremia which gradually wanes after the appearance of antibodies. There has been great progress in the development of assays based on new technologies, including microarray chips and nanotechnology, with high sensitivity and specificity which allow simultaneous screening for multiple agents in a cost effective manner. However, we cannot continue to add screening assays for every newly recognized pathogen transmissible by transfusion. Hopefully, in the foreseeable future, safe and effective pathogen inactivation technologies will allow us to limit the number of screening assays needed to ensure the safety of the blood supply.

N2  - Bronchiectasis has been described as an orphan disease in developed countries around the world, most often associated with conditions that compromise pulmonary host defenses, such a immunodeficiencies, cystic fibrosis (CF), or disorders of ciliary motility. However, worldwide, the most common etiology for bronchiectasis is probably lung injury following acute respiratory infections. The prevalence of bronchiectasis should therefore parallel the distribution of childhood mortality and hospitalization for pneumonias in very young children worldwide [1]. The lungs response to infection varies with the etiology but both viruses and bacteria can lead to chronic airway injury. Certain infections, e.g. adenoviruses of certain serotypes, produce bronchiolitis obliterans after a single infection with subsequent bronchiectasis. Severe pneumococcal pneumonia can also produce bronchiectasis as a sequelae [2]. More often, children with bronchiectasis have had recurrent acute lung infections or they experience combinations of lung infections and conditions predisposing to lung injury or airway mucus production. Chronic productive cough is more common among children passively exposed to tobacco smoke and the frequency of bronchiectasis in some populations is coincident with crowding, a high prevalence of lower respiratory tract infections, and high prevalences of smoking in families. Chronic productive cough is the most common clinical symptom associated with bronchiectasis. In some populations, the prevalence of chronic productive cough reaches up to 20% of middle school children [3]. Chronic productive cough can occur with or without associated wheezing. Bronchiectasis is associated with chronic obstructive lung disease but focal bronchiectasis does not necessarily produce air trapping or reduced airflows. In general, the more diffuse the disease, the more likely obstructive lung disease coexists. Also, approximately 40% of children and adults with bronchiectasis will have a reversible component, responsive to short acting bronchodilator treatment. Worldwide prevalences of chronic cough and bronchiectasis in children do not exist. There is likely a similar distribution of bronchiectasis to frequency of severe LRIs in children and smoking rates among families. Several infectious epidemics also contribute to the frequency distribution of childhood bronchiectasis. Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis prevalences vary across the world, these conditions both can result in recurrent or chronic pulmonary infections, and lead to bronchiectasis. Similarly the prevalence of indoor pollution, such as indoor biomass combustion, is likely to predispose to chronic airway mucus production and chronic productive cough long term. It is unlikely that the distribution of bronchiectasis prevalences will emerge soon as the diagnostic gold standard is a high resolution computerized tomographic (CT) scan of the lungs [2]. The reason bornchiectasis has been described so well in certain populations is because those populations, however rural, have access to CT scans nearby. Actionable items to reduce bronchiecatsis worldwide will be population based. Immunization programs both for pneumococcal and perhaps influenza infections must be in place. New polyvalent pneumococcal vaccines covering more than 7 serotypes are in clinical trials in young children [4]. Improved water access for hand washing will reduce the prevalence of acute respiratory infections, as well reduced crowding. Indoor tobacco and other smoke exposure needs to be reduced. Whether medical treatments such as antibiotics can alter the evolution of bronchiectasis after acute lung infections remains unclear. Safe feeding practices may reduce the risk of aspiration and these practices are amenable to public health initiatives. A better description of the magnitude of the problem is essential if chronic suppurative lung disease in childhood is to become a priority.

N2  - Background: Cerebrovascular diseases, principally stroke, can be prevented to a large extent. Yet stroke caused an estimated 5.7 million deaths in 2005 and the number of global deaths is projected to rise to 6.5 million in 2015 and to 7.8 million in 2030. Of the 5.4 million people who died of stroke, fewer than 1.0 million lived in high-income countries. In regions like Sub-Saharan Africa a health transition is occurring that is characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of epidemic infectious diseases and a growing burden of non-communicable diseases. Method(s): Stroke represents a constellation of neurologic signs and symptoms that are caused by cerebral infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). ICD-10 codes 160-169 are applicable to ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. Using broad search terms relevant to cerebrovascular disease, we searched Medline, EMBASE, LILACS, Global Health Database, and WHO regional databases from 1980 through 2007 for population-based reports on stroke incidence, prevalence, case-fatality, and mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa. Publications were screened for eligibility to identify stroke data that were population-based, that is, reporting complete coverage of non-fatal strokes in the community, fatal strokes in the community, and hospitalized strokes that were non-fatal and fatal. Result(s): Our searches yielded about 10,000 titles and abstracts on world-wide stroke epidemiologic literature, of which 44 from Sub-Saharan Africa appeared potentially eligible. Full text publications were retrieved for 42 papers (2 could not be located). A total of 12 papers met eligibility criteria. Primary reasons for exclusion were: 82% not population-based, 12% did not report epidemiologic measure of interest, 6% did not report primary data (i.e. review article, in which case the primary studies were retrieved). The table below provides characteristics of these publications. {Table presented}. Conclusion(s): While 809,115,000 people-12% of the world's population-reside in Sub-Saharan Africa, only 12 publications on population-based stroke epidemiologic parameters were identified for the period 1980-2007. Setting priorities for the prevention of stroke and strategies for care requires an empirical understanding of the patterns and impacts of disease. Integrated surveillance systems to monitor both communicable and non-communicable disease burden are critical to plan and support health services at all levels of the health system.

N2  - Objectives: Because the prevalence of nursing home associated Infection (NHAI) is high in France (14.5%) and because infection control measures for hospital can not be applied in nursing home (NH), we elaborated a survey aiming to establish consensus guidelines for prevention of NHAI for elderly living in French NH. Method(s): A nationwide survey using a two-round modified Delphi procedure (Rand Corporation) has been performed by the "Observatoire du Risque Infectieux en Geriatrie". An investigative group of 5 specialists in the field of infectious disease, geriatrics and infection control conducted a comprehensive literature search and review based on English or French published practice guidelines, systematic review and articles (or abstracts when articles were not available) on the topic of infection prevention in Long-term care Facilities, nursing homes or hospitals. The literature search has been fulfilled by 4 research analysts. The literature search has been examined by 25 specialists who compiled a preliminary list of guidelines. Using a modified Delphi survey online instrument developed by INSERM UMR-S 707 "Epidemiology, Information Systems, Modelling" and modified by the Geriatric Infection Risk Monitoring Organization (ORIG), 80 experts of all relevant medical specialities in the field of prevention and infection control or geriatrics and randomly selected medical coordinator in nursing homes, rated their agreement with each of these 301 guidelines using a 9-point scale (1=strongly disagree to 9=strongly agree). Recommendation-specific median were estimated. The consensus was defined if the recommendation was rated by at least 90% of the experts and if the median score was greater than 7. Result(s): The response rate was 93% for the first round, and 99% for the second round. The expert panel reached consensus on 264 recommendations and 37 recommendations were rejected. The different relevant topics were organisational procedures (outbreak, surveillance), basic hygiene measures, antibiotic policies, general measures linked to patient (vaccination) and multiltidrug resistant pathogens. The difference between first and second round emphasizes the issue of implementation in NH. Conclusion(s): The guidelines for NHAI prevention in French Nursing Homes will be published nationwide. A cluster-randomized controlled trial has been launched with the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of an infection prevention program, using these consensus guidelines.

N2  - Objective: To determine risk factors of healthcare associated infections in nursing home residents. Method(s): Twenty-three nursing homes were recruited to participate in SNIV, the national sentinel surveillance network for infectious diseases in nursing homes, since 2009. Influenza like illness (ILI), gastro-enteritis (GE), and probable pneumonia (PP) cases from every nursing home were registered on a weekly basis. Infections were registered by nursing home physicians using standardized clinical definitions. Results were calculated over a 44 week period. From a baseline questionnaire, nursing home characteristics were derived, e.g. number of residents, living conditions, and influenza vaccination rate of residents and healthcare workers (HCWs). Poisson regression analysis was used to determine risk factors for the occurrence of ILI, GE, and PP. Result(s): In total, 3643 nursing home residents were included. The average weekly incidence rate for GE and PP were in the same range; 3.8/1,000 cases per week and 3.7/1,000 cases per week. The average weekly incidence rate for ILI was much lower at a level of 1.9/1,000 cases per week. Table 1 shows odds ratios and confidence intervals of every significant determinant per infection. Nursing homes where residents share a toilet had a 2.6 higher risk of GE cases. Furthermore, nursing homes in which GE outbreaks occurred previously, GE incidence turned out to be higher in the current year (p < 0.0001). Nursing homes that didn't have single rooms only, had a 2.64 higher PP incidence (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, incidence was 42% higher when HCWs worked on multiple departments (p = 0.0001). Influenza vaccination degree of HCWs is a protecting determinant for ILI in residents, especially in the larger nursing homes and in nursing homes where HCWs are working on multiple departments. Conclusion(s): Infections in nursing homes could be predicted by nursing home characteristics quite well, despite a relatively small sample size. Nevertheless, to achieve a real indication of incidence rates, infection rates should be registered for the whole year, taking seasonality of some infectious diseases into account.

N2  - Mass dispensing of medical countermeasures has been proven to be an effective and crucial means to contain the outbreak of highly infectious disease. The large influx of individuals to the point-of dispensing (POD) centers to receive vaccinations or prophylactic treatment, however, raises the potential risk of serious intra-facility cross-infections. To mitigate the effect, a thorough understanding of how disease propagates during the dispensing under different transmission parameters versus POD design and operational factors is necessary. In this study, we employ a large-scale simulation/optimization decision support system, RealOpt, to analyze the propagation of highly infectious disease within dispensing sites. The simulation results are validated and benchmarked by a mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations. Pros and cons of using analytical versus simulation tools are discussed. We further perform sensitivity analysis on the dynamics of intra-POD disease propagation, and explore feasible mitigation strategies for effective mass dispensing.

N2  - A review of published literature on viral hepatitis infections in Pakistan is presented. A total of 220 abstracts available in the Pakmedinet and Medline have been searched. All relevant articles were reviewed to determine the prevalence of hepatitis viral infections in Pakistan. Two hundred and three (203) relevant articles/abstracts including twenty nine supporting references are included in this review. Of the articles on prevalence of hepatitis infection, seven were related to Hepatitis A, fifteen to Hepatitis E while the remaining articles were on frequency of hepatitis B and C in different disease and healthy population groups. These included eight studies on healthy children, three on vertical transmission, nineteen on pregnant women, fifteen on healthy individuals, six on army recruits, thirty one on blood donors, thirteen on health care workers, five on unsafe injections, seventeen on high risk groups, five on patients with provisional diagnosis of hepatitis, thirty three on patients with chronic liver disease, four on genotypes of HBV and five on genotypes of HCV. This review highlights the lack of community-based epidemiological work as the number of subjects studied were predominantly patients, high risk groups and healthy blood donors. High level of Hepatitis A seroconversion was found in children and this viral infection accounts for almost 50%-60% of all cases of acute viral hepatitis in children in Pakistan. Hepatitis E is endemic in the country affecting mostly the adult population and epidemic situations have been reported from many parts of the country. The mean results of HBsAg and Anti-HCV prevalence on the basis of data aggregated from several studies was calculated which shows 2.3% and 2.5% prevalence of HBsAg and Anti-HCV in children, 2.5% and 5.2% among pregnant women, 2.6% and 5.3% in general population, 3.5% and 3.1% in army recruits, 2.4% and 3.6% in blood donors, 6.0% and 5.4% in health care workers, 13.0% and 10.3% in high risk groups, 12.3% and 12.0% in patients with provisional diagnosis of hepatitis and 25.7% and 54% in patients with chronic liver disease respectively. This review has illustrated the high endemicity of hepatitis viral infections in Pakistan where hepatitis B and C potentially account for a serious burden of the disease. This review has triggered the launching of a network intervention for the control of hepatitis viral infectious. This review was used as the basis for the launch of hepatitis programme, but putting it into a formal review took time and the hepatitis program was initiated.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Many zoonotic, novel infectious diseases in humans appear as sporadic infections with spatially and temporally restricted outbreaks, as seen with influenza A(H5N1). Adaptation is often a key factor for successfully establishing sustained human-tohuman transmission. Here we use simple mathematical models to describe different adaptation scenarios with particular reference to spatial heterogeneity within the human population. We present analytical expressions for the probability of emergence per introduction, as well as the waiting time to a successful emergence event. Furthermore, we derive general analytical results for the statistical properties of emergence events, including the probability distribution of outbreak sizes. We compare our analytical results with a stochastic model, which has previously been studied computationally. Our results suggest that, for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has only a weak effect on outbreak size distributions, and on the risk of emergence per introduction. For example, if R0 = 1.4 or larger, any village connected to a large city by just ten commuters a day is, effectively, just a part of the city when considering the chances of emergence and the outbreak size distribution. We present empirical data on commuting patterns and show that the vast majority of communities for which such data are available are at least this well interconnected. For plausible parameter ranges, the effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host adaptation. We conclude by discussing implications for surveillance and control of emerging infections. © 2010 Kubiak et al.

N2  - For many diseases (e.g., sexually transmitted infections, STIs), most individuals are aware of the potential risks of becoming infected, but choose not to take action ('respond') despite the information that aims to raise awareness and to increases the responsiveness or alertness of the population. We propose a simple mathematical model that accounts for the diffusion of health information disseminated as a result of the presence of a disease and an 'active' host population that can respond to it by taking measures to avoid infection or if infected by seeking treatment early. In this model, we assume that the whole population is potentially aware of the risk but only a certain proportion chooses to respond appropriately by trying to limit their probability of becoming infectious or seeking treatment early. The model also incorporates a level of responsiveness that decays over time. We show that if the dissemination of information is fast enough, infection can be eradicated. When this is not possible, information transmission has an important effect in reducing the prevalence of the infection. We derive the full characterisation of the global behaviour of the model, and we show that the parameter space can be divided into three parts according to the global attractor of the system which is one of the two disease-free steady states or the endemic equilibrium. © 2010.

T1  - A hypothetical explanatory model for meningococcal meningitis in the African meningitis belt
A1  - Mueller J.E.
A1  - Gessner B.D. 
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Despite much progress in surveillance and biological research, no explanation exists to date for the epidemic pattern of meningitis in the African meningitis belt, which is required to mathematically model the impact of vaccine strategies or to predict epidemics. This paper presents a hypothetical explanatory model for epidemic meningococcal meningitis. Four incidence patterns are defined as model states, including endemic incidence during the rainy season, ubiquitous hyperendemicity during the dry season, occasional localized epidemics, and-at the regional level-regular epidemic waves spanning over communities or years. While the transition from endemic to hyperendemic situation in a community is caused by an increase in risk of meningitis given colonization by a virulent meningococcus (due to damage of the pharyngeal mucosa by dry climate), the transition from hyperendemic to epidemic situation involves increased pharyngeal colonization and transmission (possibly caused by viral respiratory infection epidemics). The described mechanisms are sufficient to explain the 10- to 100-fold incidence increase that both transitions usually imply. Epidemic waves occur if new meningococcal strains which escape pre-existing immunity, enter the population. Future research should include the impact of viral co-infection on bacterial colonization and invasion. © 2009 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

T1  - Modeling the effects of weather and climate change on malaria transmission
A1  - Parham P.E.
A1  - Michael E. 
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Background: In recent years, the impact of climate change on human health has attracted considerable attention; the effects on malaria have been of particular interest because of its disease burden and its transmission sensitivity to environmental conditions. Objective(s): We investigated and illustrated the role that dynamic process-based mathematical models can play in providing strategic insights into the effects of climate change on malaria transmission. Method(s): We evaluated a relatively simple model that permitted valuable and novel insights into the simultaneous effects of rainfall and temperature on mosquito population dynamics, malaria invasion, persistence and local seasonal extinction, and the impact of seasonality on transmission. We illustrated how large-scale climate simulations and infectious disease systems may be modeled and analyzed and how these methods may be applied to predicting changes in the basic reproduction number of malaria across Tanzania. Result(s): We found extinction to be more strongly dependent on rainfall than on temperature and identified a temperature window of around 32-33degreeC where endemic transmission and the rate of spread in disease-free regions is optimized. This window was the same for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, but mosquito density played a stronger role in driving the rate of malaria spread than did the Plasmodium species. The results improved our understanding of how temperature shifts affect the global distribution of at-risk regions, as well as how rapidly malaria outbreaks take off within vulnerable populations. Conclusion(s): Disease emergence, extinction, and transmission all depend strongly on climate. Mathematical models offer powerful tools for understanding geographic shifts in incidence as climate changes. Nonlinear dependences of transmission on climate necessitates consideration of both changing climate trends and variability across time scales of interest.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Of the 33.2 million persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), one-third are estimated to also be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In 2008, there were an estimated 1.4 million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) among persons with HIV infection, and TB accounted for 26% of AIDS-related deaths. The relative risk of TB among HIV-infected persons, compared with that among HIV-uninfected persons, ranges from 20- and 37-fold, depending on the state of the HIV epidemic. In 2008, 1.4 million patients with TB were tested globally for HIV, and 81 countries tested more than half of their patients with TB for HIV. Only 4% of all persons infected with HIV were screened for TB in the same year. Decentralization of HIV treatment services and strengthening of its integration with TB services are essential. Use of the highly decentralized TB services as an entry point to rapidly expand access to antiretroviral therapy and methods for prevention of HIV infection must be pursued aggressively. © 2010 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

N2  - A large number (n=591) of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) outbreaks have been reported in wild birds of Europe from October 2005 through January 2009. Consequently, prevention and control strategies have been implemented in response to the outbreaks and considerable discussion has taken place regarding the need for implementing surveillance programs in high-risk areas with the objective of early detecting and preventing HPAIV epidemics. However countries ability to define the temporal and spatial extension of the high risk areas has been impaired by the lack of information on the distribution of susceptible wild bird populations in the region. Here, a technique for the detection of time-space disease clustering that does not require information on the distribution of susceptible populations and that has been referred to as the time-space permutation model of the scan statistic was used to identify areas and times of the year in which epidemics of H5N1 HPAIV were most likely to occur in wild bird populations of Europe from October, 2005, through December, 2008. The scan statistic was parameterized considering pre-existing knowledge on the epidemiological and ecological characteristics of the disease in the region. Robustness of the results was assessed using a generalized linear regression model to compare the outcomes of 36 alternative parameterizations of the scan statistic. Ten significant time-space clusters of H5N1 HPAI outbreaks were detected in six European countries. Results were sensitive (P<0.05) to the definition of the maximum spatial size defined for the clusters. Results presented here will help to identify high risk areas for HPAIV surveillance in the European Union. Assumptions, results, and implications of the analytical model are extensively presented and discussed in order to facilitate the use of this approach for the identification of high risk areas for infectious animal disease surveillance in the absence of population data.Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: An understanding of the factors that determine the risk of members of a susceptible population becoming infected is essential for estimating the potential for disease spread, as opposed to just focusing on transmission from an infected population. Furthermore, analysis of the risk factors can reveal important characteristics of an epidemic and further develop understanding of the processes operating. Method(s): This paper describes the development of a mixed effects logistic regression model of susceptibility of holdings to foot and mouth disease (FMD) during the 2001 epidemic in Great Britain following the imposition of a national ban on the movements of susceptible animals (NMB). Result(s): The principal risk factors identified in the model were shorter distances to the nearest infectious seed (a holding infected before the NMB) and the county of the holding (principally Cumbria). Additional risk factors included holdings that are mixed species rather than single species, the surface area of the holding, and the number of cattle within 10 km (all p < 0.001), but not surrounding sheep densities (p > 0.1). The fit of the model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) and the Hosmer and Lemeshow Chi-squared statistic; the fit was good with both tests (area under the ROC = 0.962 and Hosmer and Lemeshow Chi-squared statistic = 49.98 (p > 0.1)). Conclusion(s): Holdings at greatest risk of infection can be identified using simple readily available risk factors; this information could be employed in the control of future FMD epidemics. © 2009 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

T1  - Optimizing infectious disease interventions during an emerging epidemic
A1  - Wallinga J.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - The emergence and global impact of the novel influenza A(H1N1)v highlights the continuous threat to public health posed by a steady stream of new and unexpected infectious disease outbreaks in animals and humans. Once an emerging epidemic is detected, public health authorities will attempt to mitigate the epidemic by, among other measures, reducing further spread as much as possible. Scarce and/or costly control measures such as vaccines, anti-infective drugs, and social distancing must be allocated while epidemiological characteristics of the disease remain uncertain. Here we present first principles for allocating scarce resources with limited data. We show that under a broad class of assumptions, the simple rule of targeting intervention measures at the group with the highest risk of infection per individual will achieve the largest reduction in the transmission potential of a novel infection. For vaccination of susceptible persons, the appropriate risk measure is force of infection; for social distancing, the appropriate risk measure is incidence of infection. Unlike existing methods that rely on detailed knowledge of group-specific transmission rates, the method described here can be implemented using only data that are readily available during an epidemic, and allows ready adaptation as the epidemic progresses. The need to observe risk of infection helps to focus the ongoing planning and design of new infectious disease surveillance programs; from the presented first principles for allocating scarce resources, we can adjust the prioritization of groups for intervention when new observations on an emerging epidemic become available.

T1  - The dynamics of an epidemic model with targeted antiviral prophylaxis
A1  - Qiu Z.
A1  - Feng Z. 
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Due to the increasing risk of drug resistance and side effects with large-scale antiviral use, it has been suggested to provide antiviral drugs only to susceptibles who have had contacts with infectives. This antiviral distribution strategy is referred to as 'targeted antiviral prophylaxis'. The question of how effective this strategy is in infection control is of great public heath interest. In this paper, we formulate an ordinary differential equation model to describe the transmission dynamics of infectious disease with targeted antiviral prophylaxis, and provide the analysis of dynamical behaviours of the model. The control reproduction number Rc is derived and shown to govern the disease dynamics, and the stability analysis is carried out. The local bifurcation theory is applied to explore the variety of dynamics of the model. Our theoretical results show that the system undergoes two Hopf bifurcations due to the existence of multiple endemic equilibria and the switch of their stability. Numerical results demonstrate that the system may have more complex dynamical behaviours including multiple periodic solutions and a homoclinic orbit. The results of this study suggest that the possibility of complex disease dynamics can be driven by the use of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, and the critical level of prophylaxis which achieves Rc = 1 is not enough to control the prevalence of a disease. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Background: Secondary transmission after point-source outbreaks is an integral feature of the epidemiology of gastrointestinal pathogens such as norovirus. The household is an important site of these secondary cases. It can become the source of further community transmission as well as new point-source outbreaks. Consequently, time-series data from exposed households provide information for risk assessment and intervention. Method(s): Analysis of these data requires models that can address (1) dependencies in infection transmission, (2) random variability resulting from households with few members, and (3) unobserved state variables important to transmission. We use Monte Carlo maximum likelihood via data augmentation for obtaining estimates of the transmission rate and infectious period from household outbreaks with the 3 above features. Result(s): We apply this parameter estimation technique to 153 infection sequences within households from a norovirus outbreak in Sweden and obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the daily rate of transmission (betaOV0404; = 0.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.08-0.24) and average infectious period (1/gammaOV0538; = 1.17 days, 95% CI = 1.00-1.88). We also demonstrate the robustness of the estimates to missing household sizes and asymptomatic infections. Conclusion(s): Maximum likelihood techniques such as these can be used to estimate transmission parameters under conditions of unobserved states and missing household size data, and to aid in the understanding of secondary risks associated with point-source outbreaks. © 2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Background. We examined the role of aerosol transmission of influenza in an acute ward setting. Methods. We investigated a seasonal influenza A outbreak that occurred in our general medical ward (with open bay ward layout) in 2008. Clinical and epidemiological information was collected in real time during the outbreak. Spatiotemporal analysis was performed to estimate the infection risk among patients. Airflow measurements were conducted, and concentrations of hypothetical virus-laden aerosols at different ward locations were estimated using computational fluid dynamics modeling. Results. Nine inpatients were infected with an identical strain of influenza A/H3N2 virus. With reference to the index patient's location, the attack rate was 20.0% and 22.2% in the "same" and "adjacent" bays, respectively, but 0% in the "distant" bay (P = .04). Temporally, the risk of being infected was highest on the day when noninvasive ventilation was used in the index patient; multivariate logistic regression revealed an odds ratio of 14.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.7-131.3; P = .015). A simultaneous, directional indoor airflow blown from the "same" bay toward the "adjacent" bay was found; it was inadvertently created by an unopposed air jet from a separate air purifier placed next to the index patient's bed. Computational fluid dynamics modeling revealed that the dispersal pattern of aerosols originated from the index patient coincided with the bed locations of affected patients. Conclusions. Our findings suggest a possible role of aerosol transmission of influenza in an acute ward setting. Source and engineering controls, such as avoiding aerosol generation and improving ventilation design, may warrant consideration to prevent nosocomial outbreaks. © 2010 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

N2  - The risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections (STIs) depends on individual behavior and the network of risky partnerships in which an individual participates. STI epidemics often spread rapidly and primarily among individuals central to transmission networks; and thus they often defy the mass-action principle since incidence is not proportional to the infectious fraction of the population. Here, we estimate the contact network structure for an Atlanta, Georgia community with heterogeneous sexual and drug-related risk behaviors and build a detailed transmission model for HIV through this population. We show that accurate estimation of epidemic incidence requires careful measurement and inclusion of diverse factors including concurrency (having multiple partners), the duration of partnerships, serosorting (preference for partners with matching disease state), and heterogeneity in the number and kinds of partners. In the focal population, we find that injection drug users (IDUs) do not directly cause many secondary infections; yet they bridge the heterosexual and men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) populations and are thereby indirectly responsible for extensive transmission. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background. In April 2009, an elementary school outbreak of pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza was reported in a community in northern British Columbia, Canada - an area that includes both non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal residents living on or off a reserve. During the outbreak investigation, we explored the relationship between prior receipt of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and pH1N1-related illness. Methods. A telephone survey was conducted from 15 May through 5 June 2009 among households of children attending any school in the affected community. Members of participating households where influenza-like illness (ILI) was described were then invited to submit blood samples for confirmation of pH1N1 infection by hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization assays. Circulation of pH1N1 was concentrated among households of the elementary school and elsewhere on-reserve to which analyses of TIV effect were thus restricted. Odds ratios (ORs) for the TIV effect on ILI were computed through logistic regression, with adjustment for age, comorbidity, household density, and Aboriginal status. The influence of within-household clustering was assessed through generalized-linear-mixed models. Results. Of 408 participants, 92 (23%) met ILI criteria: 29 (32%) of 92 persons with ILI, compared with 61 (19%) 316 persons without ILI, had received the 2008-2009 formulation of TIV. Fully adjusted ORs for 2008-2009 TIV effect on ILI were 2.45 (95% confidence interval, 1.34-4.48) by logistic regression and 2.68 [95% confidence interval, 1.37-5.25) by generalized-linear-mixed model. Conclusions. An outbreak investigation in British Columbia during the late spring of 2009 provided the first indication of an unexpected association between receipt of TIV and pH1N1 illness. This led to 5 additional studies through the summer 2009 in Canada, each of which corroborated these initial findings. © 2010 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

N2  - Vaccinia virus (VACV) was used as the vaccine strain to eradicate smallpox. VACV is still administered to healthcare workers or researchers who are at risk of contracting the virus, and to military personnel. Thus, VACV represents a weapon against outbreaks, both natural (e.g., monkeypox) or man-made (bioterror). This virus is also used as a vector for experimental vaccine development (cancer/infectious disease). As a prototypic poxvirus, VACV is a model system for studying host-pathogen interactions. Until recently, little was known about the targets of host immune responses, which was likely owing to VACVs large genome (>200 open reading frames). However, the last few years have witnessed an explosion of data, and VACV has quickly become a useful model to study adaptive immune responses. This review summarizes and highlights key findings based on identification of VACV antigens targeted by the immune system (CD4, CD8 and antibodies) and the complex interplay between responses. © 2010 Future Medicine Ltd.

N2  - In contrast to the experience in other European countries, the onset of the A(H1N1)2009 influenza virus epidemic was unexpectedly slow in France during the first part of autumn 2009. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that intense circulation of rhinoviruses might have reduced the probability of infection by A(H1N1)2009 virus at the beginning of autumn 2009. Systematic analysis for the detection of A(H1N1)2009 (H1N1) and human rhinovirus (HRV) was performed by RT-PCR from week 36 to week 48 on respiratory samples sent to the diagnostic laboratory by the paediatric hospital (n =2121). Retrospective analysis of the obtained data, using 2 x 2 contingency tables with Fisher's exact test, revealed evidence of an inverse relationship between HRV and H1N1 detection. Between weeks 36 and 48 of 2009, both HRV and H1N1 were detected but in different time frames. HRV dispersed widely during early September, peaking at the end of the month, whereas the H1N1 epidemic began during mid-October and was still active at the end of this survey. During the co-circulation period of these two respiratory viruses (weeks 43-46), HRV detection appeared to reduce the likelihood of H1N1 detection in the same sample (OR = 0.08-0.24 p <0.0001). These results support the hypothesis that HRV infections can reduce the probability of A(H1N1) infection. This viral interference between respiratory viruses could have affected the spread of the H1N1 viruses and delayed the influenza pandemic at the beginning of autumn in France. © 2010 The Authors.

T1  - Analysis of a stochastic SIR epidemic on a random network incorporating household structure

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - This paper is concerned with a stochastic SIR (susceptible -> infective -> removed) model for the spread of an epidemic amongst a population of individuals, with a random network of social contacts, that is also partitioned into households. The behaviour of the model as the population size tends to infinity in an appropriate fashion is investigated. A threshold parameter which determines whether or not an epidemic with few initial infectives can become established and lead to a major outbreak is obtained, as are the probability that a major outbreak occurs and the expected proportion of the population that are ultimately infected by such an outbreak, together with methods for calculating these quantities. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that these asymptotic quantities accurately reflect the behaviour of finite populations, even for only moderately sized finite populations. The model is compared and contrasted with related models previously studied in the literature. The effects of the amount of clustering present in the overall population structure and the infectious period distribution on the outcomes of the model are also explored. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Variability order of the latent and the infectious periods in a deterministic SEIR epidemic model and evaluation of control effectiveness

N2  - We use distribution theory and ordering of non-negative random variables to study the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model with two control measures, quarantine and isolation, to reduce the spread of an infectious disease. We identify that the probability distributions of the latent period and the infectious period are primary features of the SEIR model to formulate the epidemic threshold and to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention measures. If the primary features are changed, the conclusions will be altered in an importantly different way. For the latent and infectious periods with known mean values, it is the dilation, a generalization of variance, of their distributions that ranks the effectiveness of these control measures. We further propose ways to set quarantine and isolation targets to reduce the controlled reproduction number below the threshold using observed initial growth rate from outbreak data. If both quarantine and isolation are 100% effective, one can directly use the observed growth rate for setting control targets. If they are not 100% effective, some further knowledge of the distributions is required. © 2009.

N2  - Background. Patients hospitalized in resource-poor health care settings are at increased risk for hospital-acquired respiratory infections due to inadequate infrastructure. Methods. From 1 April 2007 through 31 March 2008, we used a low-cost surveillance strategy to identify new onset of respiratory symptoms in patients hospitalized for >72 h and in health care workers in medicine and pediatric wards at 3 public tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh. Results. During 46,273 patient-days of observation, we recorded 136 episodes of hospital-acquired respiratory disease, representing 1.7% of all patient hospital admissions; rates by ward ranged from 0.8 to 15.8 cases per 1000 patient-days at risk. We identified 22 clusters of respiratory disease, 3 of which included both patients and health care workers. Of 226 of heath care workers who worked on our surveillance wards, 61 (27%) experienced a respiratory illness during the study period. The cost of surveillance was US$43 per month per ward plus 30 min per day in data collection. Conclusions. Patients on these study wards frequently experienced hospital-acquired respiratory infections, including 1 in every 20 patients hospitalized for >72 h on 1 ward. The surveillance method was useful in calculating rates of hospital-acquired respiratory illness and could be used to enhance capacity to quickly detect outbreaks of respiratory disease in health care facilities where systems for outbreak detection are currently limited and to test interventions to reduce transmission of respiratory pathogens in resource-poor settings. © 2010 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

N2  - Background. Single-site studies have suggested a link between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). Methods. Population-level incidence of HIV-infected patients with CA-MRSA versus community-associated methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (CA-MSSA) infection was assessed in the Cook County Health and Hospitals System (CCHHS), a multi-hospital and ambulatory care center. Rates in zip codes, including those with a high density of individuals with prior incarceration (ie, high-risk zip codes), were calculated. We did a nested casecontrol analysis of hospitalized HIV-infected patients with S. aureus skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs). Results. In CCHHS, the incidence of CA-MRSA SSTIs was 6-fold higher among HIV-infected patients than it was among HIV-negative patients (996 per 100,000 HIV-infected patients vs 157 per 100,000 other patients; P< .001). The incidence of CA-MRSA SSTIs among HIV-infected patients significantly increased from 2000-2003 (period 1) to 2004-2007 (period 2) (from 411 to 1474 cases per 100,000 HIV-infected patients; relative risk [RR], 3.6; P<.001), with cases in period 1 clustering in an area 6.3 km in diameter (P = .035) that overlapped highrisk zip codes. By period 2, CA-MRSA SSTIs among HIV-infected patients were spread throughout Cook County. USA300 was identified as the predominant strain by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (accounting for 86% of isolates). Among hospitalized HIV-infected patients, the incidence of CA-MRSA increased significantly from period 1 to period 2 (from 190 to 779 cases per 100,000 HIV-infected patients; RR, 4.1; P<.001). Risks for CA-MRSA by multivariate analysis were residence in alternative housing (eg, shelters), residence in high-risk zip codes, younger age, and infection in period 2. Conclusions. HIV-infected patients are at markedly increased risk for CA-MRSA infection. This risk may be amplified by overlapping community networks of high-risk patients that may be targets for prevention efforts. ©2010 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

N2  - The Russian federation has been undergoing a concentrated epidemic of HIV-1 with high rates of infection among injecting drug users. Less is known about the relative risk and contribution to the country's HIV epidemic by other at-risk populations including sex workers and men who have sex with men. The goals of this project were to explore demographic characteristics, substance use patterns, and estimate the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and high-risk behaviors among male sex workers (MSW) in Moscow and to assess the feasibility of prospective cohort recruitment and retention among this population. Research design was a longitudinal study of 50 men with a six-month follow-up period. Participants were recruited through venue-based and snowball sampling methods. Results revealed an HIV prevalence at baseline of 16%; one MSW seroconverted during the follow-up period, yielding an incidence estimate of 4.8/100PY (95%CI 0.0-11.2). Twenty-four percentage were diagnosed with at least one STI: 12% had syphilis; 8% had Human Papilloma Virus (HPV); and 4% had Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)-2. Three (6%) of the study participants had evidence of previous Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) exposure at baseline. Retention rates were poor with higher retention significantly associated with older men (OR: 13.1, 95% CI 3.3-52.5). This was the first study to evaluate baseline demographics, substance use patterns, and prevalence of infectious disease among MSW in Moscow. Identification and recruitment of this population appears to be feasible, but retention a challenge. While the sample size in the current study was small, the results also suggested that this is a population at considerable high risk for HIV. MSW in Moscow may be an important at-risk population in the Russian HIV epidemic and further research is urgently required to address their needs and explore prevention strategies.

N2  - Background and Objectives: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has identified health care workers (HCWs) as a priority group to receive influenza vaccine. Although the importance of HCW to the health care system is well understood, the potential role of HCW in transmission during an epidemic has not been clearly established. Method(s): Using a standard SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) framework similar to previously developed pandemic models, we developed an agent-based model (ABM) of Allegheny County, PA, that incorporates the key health care system features to simulate the spread of an influenza epidemic and its effect on hospital-based HCWs. Finding(s): Our simulation runs found the secondary attack rate among unprotected HCWs to be approximately 60% higher (54.3%) as that of all adults (34.1%), which would result in substantial absenteeism and additional risk to HCW families. Understanding how a pandemic may affect HCWs, who must be available to treat infected patients as well as patients with other medical conditions, is crucial to policy makers' and hospital administrators' preparedness planning. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Background: Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have triggered multiple outbreaks. However, VRE of genotype vanC appear not to be associated with outbreaks. The goal of this study was to estimate the risk of bloodstream infections in patients colonized with VRE of genotype vanC who received care from a bone marrow transplant unit for patients with leukemia, where only standard precautions were implemented for VRE of genotype vanC during the last 9 years. Method(s): Since 2000, all patients in the bone marrow transplant unit underwent routine VRE rectal screening, data were prospectively entered in a database, and isolates were molecularly characterized. Infection control policy required contact isolation for patients infected with VRE of genotype vanA or vanB but only standard precautions for patients infected with VRE of genotype vanC. Result(s): From January 2000 to July 2008, 290 isolates of VRE of genotype vanC obtained from 273 different patients were identified, with an incidence of 25-43 isolates/year. Of 290 isolates, 285 (98%) were identified in rectal screening swabs, 5 were from other body sites, and none required specific treatment. During the entire study period, only 1 case of bloodstream infection was detected, reflecting an incidence of 1 (0.4%) of the 273 patients, or <0.2 cases per 1000 patient-days. No outbreaks were recorded. Conclusion(s): These data provide strong evidence that carriers of VRE of genotype vanC do not require contact isolation, thereby saving resources and potentially improving patient care. The genotype should be routinely determined in areas with a high prevalence of VRE of genotype vanC. © 2010 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background. Pregnant women have been identified as a group at risk of increased morbidity and mortality associated with the pandemic H1N1 influenza A 2009 (H1N1/09) outbreak. Methods. Six hospitals in the state of Victoria, Australia, contributed retrospective and prospective demographic and clinical data, reason for admission data, and maternal and fetal outcome data for women with laboratory-confirmed H1N1/09 admitted to the hospital from 20 May 2009 through 31 July 2009. Results. Forty-three cases were reported during the study period, including 8 intensive care unit admissions, 1 maternal death, 2 fetal deaths, and 1 neonatal death. The most common reason for admission was uncomplicated influenza-like illness. Patients hospitalized for uncomplicated influenza-like illness had a length of stay significantly less than those with confirmed pneumonia. Thirty-six percent of women delivered during the hospitalization. Of the women delivering before 37 weeks' gestation, almost all had pneumonia. Almost half of our case series had no other comorbidity, a large proportion (77%) of women received antivirals, and 56% received antibiotics. The incidence of hospitalization was estimated at 0.46% (95% confidence interval, 0.31%-0.66%) of all 6094 pregnant women in the third trimester during the 3-month study period. The incidence of hospitalization in the second trimester was estimated at 0.21% (95% confidence interval, 0.11%-0.36%). Conclusions. This case series confirms a high number of complications in pregnant women due to pandemic H1N1/09. Many of these women had comorbidities, although almost 50% of the women in this case series who required hospitalization did not have an additional risk factor other than being pregnant. © 2010 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

N2  - Background. In 2006, the largest mumps outbreak in the United States in 20 years occurred. To understand prior mumps seroprevalence and factors associated with the presence of antibody to mumps virus, data from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed. Methods. A mumps virus-specific enzyme immunoassay was used to measure the seroprevalence of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody among NHANES participants aged 6-49 years. Participants were grouped on the basis of 10-year birth cohorts, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using SUDAAN software, and logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors. Results. The overall age-adjusted seroprevalence of IgG antibody to mumps virus during 1999-2004 was 90.0% (95% CI, 88.8%-91.1%). Seroprevalence was higher among US-born non-Hispanic blacks (96.4% [95% CI, 95.5%- 97.2%]) and non-US-born Mexican Americans (93.7% [95% CI, 92.0%-95.2%]). Seroprevalence was significantly lower in the 1967-1976 birth cohort (85.7% [95% CI, 83.5%-87.8%]). The variables sex, education, and race/ ethnicity/birthplace were independent predictors in at least 1 of the birth cohorts. Conclusions. The overall estimate of 90.0% is at the lower end of the estimated population immunity (90%- 92%) needed to achieve herd immunity. Lower seroprevalence among groups suggest that they represent populations at an increased risk. For mumps control, high vaccine coverage and high population immunity must be achieved and maintained. © 2010 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

T1  - Sinusoidal Cox regression-A rare cancer example
A1  - Efird J.T. 
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Evidence of an association between survival time and date of birth would suggest an etiologic role for a seasonally variable environmental exposure occurring within a narrow perinatal time period. Risk factors that may exhibit seasonal epidemicity include diet, infectious agents, allergens, and antihistamine use. Typically data has been analyzed by simply categorizing births into months or seasons of the year and performing multiple pairwise comparisons. This paper presents a statistically robust alternative, based upon a trigonometric Cox regression model, to analyze the cyclic nature of birth dates related to patient survival. Disease birth-date results are presented using a sinusoidal plot with peak date(s) of relative risk and a single P value that indicates whether an overall statistically significant seasonal association is present. Advantages of this derivative-free method include ease of use, increased power to detect statistically significant associations, and the ability to avoid arbitrary, subjective demarcation of seasons. © The author(s), publisher and licensee Libertas Academica Ltd.

N2  - Background: The purpose of this study was to determine the association of potential risk factors to the spread and maintenance of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus in poultry and humans at the district level in West Java Province, Indonesia. Method(s): The association of demography and environmental risk factors including poultry density, human density, road density, percentage of paddy field, and percentage of swamp, dyke and pond with both HPAI human cases and HPAI outbreaks in poultry were assessed using a descriptive epidemiological design. We also assessed the association of HPAI outbreaks in poultry with HPAI human cases. Poisson regression (generalized linear modeling and generalized estimating equations) was used to analyze the data corrected for over-dispersion. Result(s): There were 794 HPAI outbreaks in poultry covering 24 of the 25 districts in our study during 2003-2008 and 34 HPAI human cases involving 12 districts during 2005-2008. We found that two risk factors - poultry density and road density - had a statistically significant correlation with the number of HPAI outbreaks in poultry. The number of poultry outbreaks had a negative association with poultry density (29% effect) and a positive association with road density (67% effect). The number of human cases was significantly associated with the number of poultry outbreaks (34% effect), but with none of the other risk factors considered. Conclusion(s): We conclude that the most effective way to prevent human HPAI cases is to intervene directly in the poultry sector. Our study further suggests that implementing preventive measures in backyard chicken farming and limiting transport of live poultry and their products are promising options to this end. © 2010 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

N2  - Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses show different disease dynamics between virus strains and host species, and therefore epidemic field data are very valuable. This study used field data of the HPAI H7N1 epidemic which affected Northern Italy in 1999-2000. Field mortality data was back-calculated into a S-I-format to estimate the transmission rate parameter beta, indicating the number of birds infected per infectious bird per time unit. The bird-infectious period was assumed to be 2 days, and all birds were assumed to die after this infectious period. The estimated beta for HPAI H7N1 virus transmission in turkeys was 1.43 (95% CI: 1.17-1.74). Farm risk factors such as flock size and age of the turkeys did not influence the estimated transmission rate parameter.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Exposure to the risk of neighbourhood infection was estimated for the H7N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) epidemic that affected Northern Italy between 1999 and 2000. The two most affected regions (Lombardy and Veneto) were analyzed and the epidemic was divided into three phases. Q statistics were used to evaluate exposure to the risk of neighbourhood infection using two measures. First, a local Q statistic (Qikt) assessed daily exposure for each farm as a function of the number of neighbouring infected farms that were in their infectious period, weighted by the distance between farms. This allowed us to identify the daily time course of risk for each farm and, at any given time, local groups of farms defined by high risk. Second, for each farm a summary statistic of exposure risk within each phase (Qiph) was obtained by summing Qikt over the duration of each phase. This allowed identification of farms defined by persistent, high exposure risk within each phase of the epidemic. Statistical significance was evaluated using conditional Monte Carlo simulation, and significant values of Qiph were mapped to assess the variation of the risk of neighbourhood infection through the phases. Qikt was larger for farms in Lombardy and the reduction of exposed farms was more marked for Veneto. Although the highest value of Qiph was observed in Veneto, in each phase most of the significant values were in Lombardy. In the last phase of the epidemic, a large reduction in the number of farms significantly exposed to the risk of neighbourhood infection was observed in the Veneto region, along with generally low values of Qiph. This may be explained by differences in control measures in the two regions, including pre-emptive slaughtering of farms considered at high risk of infection. The Q statistic allowed us to quantify geographic, time-dynamic variations in exposure to neighbourhood infection, and to generate hypotheses on the efficacy of control measures.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background & Aim: We have previously screened 78 known functional variants (related to the serotoninergic, intestinal epithelial barrier, and innate immunity pathways) and identified 4 promoter and coding SNPs in the TLR9, IL6, and CDH1 regions associated with PI-IBS susceptibility1 in the well-defined Walkerton Health study cohort.2 We aimed at better defining these associations by performing thorough fine mapping in these 3 regions and functional experiments. Method(s): We used a pairwise tagging approach to select 63 SNPs that were genotyped using Sequenom hME assays. The design also included SNPs in coding and predicted regulatory regions. Analysis compared subjects who experienced GE but did not develop PI-IBS (889 controls) to those who experienced GE and reported PI-IBS 2-3 years after the outbreak (228 cases). Associations between genetic variants and PI-IBS, or related traits, were assessed using mixed effects logistic regression models. Quantitative RT-PCR and sequencing methods were used to assess gene-expression correlation in monocytes derived from 32 healthy individuals. We evaluated associations using linear regression statistic. Result(s): We observed 1 novel independent association in IL6 (rs2069861: p=0.0079) and 14 additional associations (i.e. 6 in TLR9, 3 in IL6, 4 in CDH1) that can be explained by the linkage disequilibrium with the 4 original variants. All SNPs were more significantly associated in the clinically confirmed GE subgroup (p as low as 2.6x10-4). We also evaluated and concluded that all the identified susceptibility variants in the TLR9, IL6, and CDH1 regions were independent risk factors for developing PI-IBS when compared to the previously identified clinical risk factors, including younger age, female gender, bloody stools, abdominal cramps, weight loss, and prolonged diarrhea.2 We observed a significant association between IL6 mRNA level and genotypes of rs2069861 (p=0.0366), with carrier of the risk allele being associated with the highest level of IL6 mRNA expression. Conclusion(s): This study establishes the first pillars of the genetic architecture of PI-IBS by demonstrating that variants in these 3 genes all contribute to PI-IBS susceptibility, and are all independent risk factors for developing PI-IBS when controlling for previously reported PI-IBS clinical risk factors in the Walkerton population.2 These results indicate abnormalities in genes encoding epithelial barrier functions and innate immune responses to enteric bacteria, and suggest a genetic contribution to the development of IBS following acute GE.

T1  - Low bacterial resistance in the Nordic countries - How do we stay low?

N2  - Bacterial antibiotic resistance has emerged as an important factor influencing patient mortality and morbidity. Although the clinical impact of resistant bacteria is not fully known, studies have demonstrated an association between bacterial resistance to therapeutic antibiotic agents and worse patient outcomes (1,2). It has been argued that without effective treatment and prevention of bacterial infections, we risk rolling back important achievements of modern medicine such as major surgery, organ transplantation and cancer chemotherapy (3). The Nordic countries are usually considered as low endemic countries with respect to prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the community. The reason for this is not entirely clear, but it has often been attributed to good standards of living and basic hygiene, low non-prescribed antibiotic usage and modern health care facilities. However, recent data indicate a rising resistance to quinolones and third generation cepalosporins among Enterobacteriacae and the prevalence of MRSA is also rising in the community (4). The rising rates of resistant bacteria in the general population increases the risk of significant outbreaks caused by multi-resistant pathogens among patients admitted to hospitals. The explosive nature of such an outbreak can be illustrated by the recent rapid increase in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae associated with significant morbidity and mortality in the Eastern Mediterranean region (5,6). Intensive care units (ICUs) are high-risk environments for emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. Numerous factors contribute to this risk. Antibiotic treatment is regular in the ICU with a mean use of 1.25 defined daily doses per admission in a recent European survey (7). Regular use may promote emergence of resistance, because antimicrobial pressure is an important driver of resistance, particularly for Gram-negative bacteria. Identification of infectious complications is difficult in the critically ill; this may lead to inappropriate antibiotic treatment of conditions that lack a clinical indication for antibiotics. The potential for worse outcomes for critically ill patients whose initial empirical therapy is not adequate against infecting pathogens has led to increased use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Extended antibiotic treatment courses due to complex patient cases add further to the high antimicrobial pressure. Many infections in the ICU are related to invasive devices (i.e. central venous catheters, endo-tracheal tubes, urinary catheters) which are increasingly used. Other important factors are shortage in staffing and isolation rooms that may hinder appropriate cohort care and isolation in single rooms. Frequent lapses in healthcare workers attention to basic hygiene routines is also a major cause of transmission of bacteria in ICUs. The ICU is not an isolated clinical area, but rather exists, and provides a key clinical service, in a health-care environment that often fails to adequately prevent and control healthcare associated infection. The microbiology of the ICU reflects the difficulties elsewhere in the hospital, the health service generally and in the community. Yet, much can be done within the ICU itself to hold down transmission and emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Basic hygiene. Failures in compliance to hygiene routines are a major cause of transmission of bacteria in ICUs. Such transmission can be avoided with uniform use of basic hygiene precautions applied to patients and staff, including physicians. A dress code with short sleeves for all health-care workers must be practiced. It is essential that ICU leaders make hand hygiene a priority, banning the wearing of finger rings, wrist jewelry and watches at work. The use of alcohol-based hand rub before and after every patient, and the use of gowns with every close contact must become a ritual, virtually religious behavior (8). The ICU environment. The inanimate hospital environment has resurfaced as an area for concern. Environmental surfaces are frequently contaminated with pathogens such as vancomycinresistant enterococci (VRE), meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Clostridium difficile (9). Healthcare workers can contaminate their hands after touching these surfaces and transfer potential pathogens to a patient or another environmental site. The frequent shuttling of VRE between contaminated environmental sites and patients, via staff member's hands, helps to explain how quickly VRE has become a prominent nosocomial pathogen (10). Improved cleaning and lowering of contamination rates after a multifaceted intervention program (11), suggests that surface contamination is due to a failure to clean rather than to a faulty cleaning procedure or product. Thus, to minimize contributions of environmental spread of antibioticresistant bacteria, ICU leaders should insist that the performance of the cleaning staff is reviewed routinely. Invasive devices. Prevention of device-related infections should be a major focus for control of antibiotic resistance in ICUs. Judicious utilization of invasive devices (i.e. intravascular catheters for monitoring and treatment, invasive ventilation, urinary catheters) is a first measure that must be followed by preventive interventions. Most of these preventive interventions depend on persistent application of low-technology measures such as, in the case of central venous catheters, hand washing, full-barrier precautions during the insertion of catheters, cleaning the skin with chlorhexidine, avoiding the femoral site and removing unnecessary catheters (12). There are also multiple opportunities for improvement in central venous catheter postinsertion care (13). Staffing and facilities. Overcrowding and understaffing are associated with transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria. High workload and cramped working conditions lead to failure via decreased health-care worker hand-hygiene compliance, increased movement of patients and staff, less cohorting, and overburdening of screening and isolation facilities (14). In turn, a high incidence of infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria leads to increased inpatient length of stay and bed blocking, exacerbating overcrowding and creating a vicious cycle characterised by further infection control failure. Strict adherence to guidelines and recommendations for facilities (floor space per bed) and nursing staff levels (patient-nurse ratio) for critical care will reduce the risk for cross-transmission. Diagnosis of infections. Rapid turnaround of diagnostic cultures and tests, such us procalcitonin, may reduce the need for antibiotics, shorten the length of treatment and promote specific instead of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Novel and rapid nucleic acid-based diagnostic tests to detect bacteria (PCR) may help to use isolation facilities more effectively by identifying multi-resistance earlier. Antibiotic use. Physicians are not prescribing antibiotics properly. Studies indicate that hospital physicians may be unaware of the benefits and risks of prescribing antibiotics including whether to prescribe an antibiotic, which antibiotic to prescribe, at what dose and for how long; findings that also in part apply to ICUs (7). Many different methods to improve the prescribing of antibiotics in hospitals have been studied. Restrictive methods (i.e. expert approval before use, removal/ restriction of certain antibiotics, cycling/rotation of antibiotics, automatic stop-order) have a greater short term impact than educational methods (i.e. general education, guidelines, recommendations, opinion leaders), but little is known as to the long-term effects (15). Computer-assisted microbial prescription systems with a mixed educational and restrictive approach may improve usage of antibiotics without increasing adverse outcomes (16). Audit and surveillance. A continuous audit of antimicrobial consumption and local resistance patterns with feedback to prescribers is an important way to promote rational treatment (17). Regular information on local and regional resistance patterns together with a proactive surveillance approach, the practice of performing active surveillance cultures to identify patients colonized with resistant bacteria, may help to identify emerging resistance as well as patients with MRSA, VRE and other antimicrobial resistance patterns. We practice medicine in an era when airlines carry more than two billion passengers annually, which gives ample opportunities for spread of bacteria and their resistance genes in our communities (18). Although the Nordic region is currently a low endemic region when it comes to multi-resistant bacteria this may change rapidly. To remain a region with low resistance rates in the health-care sector we must have a high level of awareness and promote sound routines and procedures.

N2  - Background: Each year an estimated 1.7 million healthcare-associated infections occur in U.S. hospitals and result in 99,000 associated deaths. In addition, an infectious disease disaster, such as a SARS outbreak or pandemic, could result in high infection transmission rates, including among healthcare personnel. Infection prevention and control is essential to preventing disease transmission. Historically, infection prevention and control education for healthcare personnel has been non-standardized due to a lack of identified competencies related to this practice. There are currently no published competencies related to infection prevention and control for routine practice or during disasters to guide education development. Prupose: The purpose of this study was to develop key competencies and terminal objectives for healthcare worker education related to infection prevention and control during routine activities as well as natural and man-made disasters. Method(s): Competencies and terminal objectives related to infection prevention and control were developed utilizing an evidence-based approach consisting of the following steps: (a) review of literature, (b) review of existing competencies and published curricula/training objectives, (c) synthesis of new competencies and terminal objectives, (d) expert panel review and competency refinement using the Delphi Survey process, and (e) delineation of competencies by occupation. The eight occupations/disciplines addressed were nurses (RNs and LPNs), nursing assistants, physicians, respiratory therapists, physical and occupational therapists, housekeepers, laboratory professionals, and ancillary staff. Three experts were identified for each of the eight healthcare worker disciplines (24 expert panelists total). The Delphi technique consisted of a series of data collection rounds to gather the opinions and judgments from the panel of infection prevention and control experts. Surveys consisted of competency and terminal objective measurement on a 5 point Likert Scale (Agree/important - Disagree/Not important) and editing of the competencies when needed. At the end of each round, responses were analyzed and summarized, then reported back to the Delphi Panel to begin the next round until group consensus was achieved. Result(s): Eight hundred forty-three references were identified and reviewed for relevance; 96 articles were deemed relevant and were analyzed in their entirety. Competency and terminal objective categories/topics were identified from the literature review. After the third round of Delphi Panel assessment, there was >90% agreement on all competency statements and terminal objectives. Conclusion(s): Infection prevention and control is essential to decreasing morbidity and mortality related to healthcare-associated infections, including decreasing healthcare personnel risk of becoming exposed to infectious agents during practice. The competencies developed through this study provide a means of measuring competence related to preventing infection transmission in healthcare settings during routine practice and disasters. Validation in the practice setting followed by incorporation into educational components for each healthcare discipline are next steps.

N2  - Background: Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of hospital associated infectious diarrhea and colitis. About 3 million cases of Clostridium difficile diarrhea occur each year with an annual cost of $1 billion. This is a substantial financial burden to the health care system and is directly related to the cost incurred from extended stay and cost of infection control procedures. It has become a very important nosocomial pathogen over the last few years, and has been given much attention as a well-recognized source of diarrheal outbreaks, affecting facilities for the elderly, patients who are very ill and immunocompromized. About 20% of patients acquire C. difficile during hospitalization. Infection with Clostridium difficile can result in serious complications, posing a threat to the patient's life. Purpose(s): The aim of this research was to demonstrate the uniqueness in the characteristics of C. difficile positive nosocomial diarrhea cases compared with C. difficile negative nosocomial diarrhea controls. METHOD(S): One hundred and ninety patients with a positive test and one hundred and ninety with a negative test for Clostridium difficile nosocomial diarrhea, selected from patients tested between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2003, comprised the study population. Demographic and clinical data were collected from medical records. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the associated odds between selected variables and the outcome of Clostridium difficile nosocomial diarrhea. Result(s): For the antibiotic classes, cephalosporins (OR, 1.87; CI 95, 1.23 to 2.85), penicillins (OR, 1.57; CI 95, 1.04 to 2.37), fluoroquinolones (OR, 1.65; CI 95,1.09 to 2.48) and antifungals (OR, 2.17; CI 95, 1.20 to 3.94), were significantly associated with Clostridium difficile nosocomial diarrhea. Ceftazidime (OR, 1.95; CI95, 1.25 to 3.03, p = 0.003), gatifloxacin (OR, 1.97; CI 95, 1.31 to 2.97, p = 0.001), clindamycin (OR, 3.13; CI 95, 1.99 to 4.93, p < 0.001) and vancomycin (OR, 1.77; CI 95,1.18 to 2.66, p = 0.006, were also significantly associated with the disease. Vancomycin was not statistically significant when analyzed in a multivariable model. Other significantly associated drugs were, antacids, laxatives, narcotics and ranitidine. Prolong use of antibiotics and an increased number of comorbid conditions were also associated with C. difficile nosocomial diarrhea. Conclusion(s): The etiology for C. difficile diarrhea is multifactorial. Exposure to antibiotics and other drugs, prolonged antibiotic usage, the presence and severity of comorbid conditions and prolonged hospital stay were shown to contribute to the development of the disease. It is imperative that any attempt to prevent the disease, or contain its spread, be done on several fronts. Nursing Implications: It is imperative that health care providers remain vigilant for the presentation of symptoms of C. difficile diarrhea, particularly if patients are receivingantibiotics or other drugs that have been shown to predispose them to C. difficile diarrhea. Early detection and treatment is critical to avert the serious complications such as toxic megacolon, and prevent prolonged hospital stay. Meticulous attention to hand hygiene to prevent further contamination of the environment, and spread to other patients, is vital. Nursing staff must also take prompt action to isolate patients who are both suspects and confirmed cases of the disease and enforce the use of dedicated equipment to prevent spread.

N2  - Vector-borne diseases occur when infectious agents (virus, protozoa, bacteria, or helminthes) are transmitted to their hosts by a carrier organism. Climate conditions and their changes play a role in the inter-relationship between these agents, the vectors, and the host (or hosts). This review is focused on arthropod-borne viruses (Arboviruses). These viruses are transmitted between susceptible vertebrate hosts by blood-feeding arthropods, and may be transmitted by blood transfusion, tissue and organ transplantation and breast feeding. The lifecycle of arboviruses is influenced by changes in temperature, rainfall, humidity, length of day, average daily solar radiation, and/or storm patterns, as well as changes in the frequency of rare events such as floods or droughts. A plethora of studies have suggested that climate changes, particularly temperature changes, are likely to be induced by increases in the amount of greenhouse gases, such as methane, carbon dioxide (CO2), and chlorofluorocarbons, which deplete ozone in the atmosphere leading to an increase in UV radiation. Current models predict that ambient temperature will increase by three to five degrees on average with a doubling in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Vectors, pathogens and hosts each survive and reproduce within a range of optimal climatic conditions: temperature and precipitation being most important, while sea level elevation, wind, and daylight duration are also important. Climate changes may affect important determinants of vector-borne disease transmission including: (i) vector survival and reproduction, (ii) the vector s biting rate, and (iii) the pathogen s incubation rate within the vector organism. Droughts can increase the dissemination of arboviral diseases in urban areas by allowing a boost in the population of mosquitoes in foul water concentrated in catch basins where they breed. Furthermore, eggs can be vertically infected with arboviruses and heat waves speed up the maturation of the mosquitoes and of the viruses within mosquitoes. Droughts also cause a decline in mosquito predators like frogs, darning needles and dragonflies. In addition, birds congregate around shrinking water sites, enhancing circulation of viruses among birds and mosquitoes. In conclusion, the seriousness of some of the recent epidemics like WNV and Dengue appear to have been influenced by climate change. Since most of the arboviral infections are asymptomatic in humans, there is an increased opportunity for blood, organ and tissue donations by infected individuals during the viremic period resulting in an increased risk of transmission of arboviruses.

N2  - Objectives: The correct management of data represents one of the most relevant factors in the processes of risk-management and control of hospital infections(HAI). Informatised laboratories, a privileged observatory for HAI surveillance, have contributed to optimise the processes of data collection and elaboration. A project aiming at transforming passive laboratory surveillance into an active "virtual" process started in the hospitals of Trentino. Method(s): A dedicated software was developed which, once integrated with the databases of the laboratories, can carry out a systematic and realtime research of the possible epidemic events, of the warning/alert events and integrated clinical data. At the same time, it can periodically control antibiotic-resistance and infection prevalence. This software is made up of three components: 1)Import, which imports data in real time through a connection to the data-base of the laboratory; 2)Elaboration, which filters the alarms on the basis of the established rules; 3)Report, which produces the report according to the queries defined by the user. These data are sent to the ward in electronic format using the visualisation system of the laboratory reports and, at the same time, a notification file is produced for the infection control unit. In the second phase of the process, the wards give the notification with the clinical information back to the laboratory and it is filed in a normalised and standardised data structure for a real-time monitoring which also constitutes a historical database for longer periods. Result(s): In the first three months the surveillance system has highlighted its considerable potentialities. 4 outbreaks have been precociously detected, as well as numerous microorganisms and alert events followed by the immediate activation of processes and precautions aiming at circumscribing and limiting their diffusion. A major sensitivity of health-workers to HAI and bacterial resistance problems and a better integration between laboratories, wards and infection control personnel were highlighted as well. Conclusion(s): The described system has proved able to increase the monitoring, control, treatment and prevention power against hospital infections. Such system integrates the surveillance programs which are already active with a tool able to detect outbreaks precociously and to provide a rapid alert system for the ward, which can thus precociously activate the necessary precautions to limit infectious events.

N2  - Objectives: The incidence of extended spectrum fl-lactamase producing (ESBL) bacteria is increasing. Isolation precautions are recommended to prevent transmission. Delayed diagnosis of ESBL colonisation may increase the risk for nosocomial outbreaks. We report an outbreak of ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) on a 10-bed medical intensive care unit (ICU) and surveillance and infection control measures taken to interrupt transmission. Method(s): All infected or colonised patients were isolated and cohorted if possible. Hand hygiene was reinforced and surveillance cultures were performed (rectal swabs every 2nd day in all patients who stayed at the ICU for >=24 hours, environmental sampling from computer keyboards, telephone receiver, water tap, rinsing tank and the lavatory). The number of beds was reduced to a fixed key according to the available staff. Result(s): The first patients were diagnosed on July 8th. Three additional patients were diagnosed on July 16th. The time between screening and isolation was 3 days according to the time needed for microbiological identification. Hand hygiene promotion was reinforced on July 11th. Surveillance cultures were initiated and environmental screening was performed when 4 additional patients were diagnosed with ESBL-KP on July 23rd. ESBL-KP was also cultured from two rinsing tanks. Water taps, rinsing tanks and lavatories were rinsed with sodium hypochlorite. On August 23rd, 2 newly colonised patients were identified. Intensified investigations could not detect further potential sources of ESBL-KP. There were no further ESBL-KP isolated after August 23rd. In total, 12 patients were affected. 7/12 patients died. Conclusion(s): The source of our ESBL outbreak could not be identified. Standard hygiene precautions and a high level of awareness for hygiene issues reduced the risk of, and subsequently interrupted transmission. Such measures are particularly important since the population at risk has a poor prognosis, supposably because of comorbidity but probably due to infectious complications too. The role of environmental or staff screening should be investigated.

N2  - Encephalitis can be caused by wide variety of infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. In addition to common viral pathogens, arthropod-borne viruses (transmitted through insect or tick-bite) can cause arboviral encephalitis. In Europe, the most important pathogens responsible for arboviral encephalitis are tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Sandfly fever virus (SFV). Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most important flavivirus infection of the central nervous system (CNS) in Europe and Russia. The epidemiology of TBE is closely related to the ecology and biology of ticks. In nature, TBE virus is propagated in a cycle involving permanently infected ticks and wild vertebrate hosts. Virus transmission occurs horizontally between tick vectors and vertebrates, with small mammals serving as virus reservoirs. TBE is distributed in an endemic pattern of natural foci over a wide geographical area focused on central Europe, the Baltic States and Russia. During the past two decades, both new endemic foci and an increase in cases have been reported in many European countries, with the major exception being Austria, which has a high vaccine coverage (> 86%). The disease has also been considered outside the traditional endemic areas. Some reports of new endemic areas are attributed to a previous under diagnosis of cases. However, the true nature of this rise is supported by an increase in areas with high awareness of the disease and with well established diagnostic routines. Environmental factors important for sustaining natural foci for tick-borne encephalitis can be modeled with satellite data. These models suggest that climate change is partly responsible for increased incidence in Europe. But, existing methods for risk assessment have limitations. Thus, risk assessment should combine human habits and socioeconomic variables with functional variables in natural foci. West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus that is maintained in a bird-mosquito transmission cycle. Humans and horses are usually incidental hosts. Historically, WNV has been associated with asymptomatic infections and sporadic disease outbreaks in humans and horses in Africa, Europe, and Asia. Although, WN fever was a minor arbovirosis, some cases of encephalitis associated with fatalities were reported in Israel in the 1950 s. However, after few silent decades, the virus has caused frequent outbreaks of severe neuroinvasive disease in humans and horses in Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. Even more, new modes of transmission through blood donations, organ transplants, and the intrauterine route have been reported. In Europe, an enhanced surveillance of WN infection in humans, horses, birds, and vectors may reveal the presence of the virus in different locations. Nevertheless, outbreaks of WN virus remain unpredictable. Further coordinated studies are needed for a better understanding of the ecology and the pathogenicity of the WN virus.

N2  - Aim: To explore if infectious episodes early in life affect celiac disease risk, and possibly contributed to the Swedish epidemic (1984-1996) of symptomatic celiac disease in children below two years of age. Method(s): A population-based incident case-referent study performed during the epidemic. Included were celiac disease cases diagnosed before 2 years of age and fulfilling ESPGHAN 1990 criteria. Cases (n = 475) and referents (n = 950), matched for age, sex and area of residence, received a questionnaire returned by 96% and 90%, respectively. Information was received on common childhood infections, socioeconomic status, and infant feeding, i.e., breast-feeding, age at introduction of dietary gluten and the amount consumed per day two weeks later. Complete data and a matched set with one case and one or two referents were available for 373 (79%) cases and 581 (61%) referents. Bivariate and multivariate conditional logistic regressions were performed. Result(s): Children with three or more infectious episodes before six months of age had increased celiac disease risk before two years of age (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.0), after adjusting for infant feeding and socioeconomic status. The risk remained also when disregarding episodes of symptomatic gastroenteritis. Belonging to a low socioeconomic group, compared to high-medium, remained an independent risk factor also in the final model. The celiac disease risk increased further if infants, in addition to several infectious episodes, were introduced to gluten in large amounts, compared to small or medium amounts (adjusted OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.5-3.7). Conclusion(s): In this incident case-referent study we found that children with three or more infectious episodes early in life had increased celiac disease risk. Thus, infectious episodes might have a causal role in celiac disease development. It is unclear whether the infectious panorama changed or not over the celiac disease epidemic period, but still our results suggest that early infections indirectly might have contributed. The reason is a synergistic effect in-between early infectious episodes and amount of gluten during introduction, where the latter changed concurrently with the beginning and ending of the epidemic. Therefore, in addition to abrupt introduction of gluten without ongoing breast-feeding, also early infections might contribute to celiac disease risk, and thereby further explain the Swedish epidemic. Our finding has implications for both increased understanding of celiac disease etiology and for exploring the possibility of primary prevention.

N2  - Aims: Citrobacter rodentium is a naturally occurring, non-invasive, murine enteric pathogen that shares many features with pathogenic E. coli species, including enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), a bacterium linked to food- and waterborne outbreaks. Colonic responses to infection with C. rodentium are similar to those found in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Consequently, C. rodentium is commonly used as a model for both acute, infectious colitis and IBD. Probiotics are live organisms which elicit beneficial effects, but further research is needed to establish their efficacy in newborns and infants. This study employed C. rodentium challenge of mouse pups to determine the effects of infection in neonates and assess whether probiotics could reduce disease burden. We hypothesized that neonatal pups would become ill following infection with C. rodentium and that probiotics would ameliorate disease severity. Method(s): C57BL/6 mouse pups were infected with C. rodentium (108 CFU in 0.05 ml LB broth) or sham-infected (LB broth) by orogastric gavage on post-natal day 14. A subset of pups were pre-treated with a mixture of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and L. rhamnosus R0011 (108 CFU orally) once daily one week prior to infection and continued for the duration of the experiment. Maltodextrin served as the vehicle control. To determine if probiotics could act indirectly, the probiotic mixture was provided to the dam directly in drinking water. Neonatal Rag1 deficient (Rag1-KO) pups were used to determine the role of adaptive immunity in mediating the effects of probiotics. Result(s): At 10 days post-infection (PI), infected pups exhibited significant weight loss and colonic epithelial cell hyperplasia compared to sham-infected pups. By 12 days PI, death occurred only in infected animals (C. rodentium; 75% mortality versus sham; 0%). Pre-treatment with probiotics significantly reduced mortality (C. rodentium; 75% mortality compared with probiotics; 17%, p<0.05), colonic epithelial cell hyperplasia, and attenuated weight loss. Probiotics did not prevent death in infected pups when administered either to the mother or in Rag1-KO pups. Conclusion(s): C. rodentium infection causes severe colonic inflammation resulting in weight loss and death in neonatal mice. Pre- and co-treatment with probiotics to the pups prevents these effects, but only when provided directly and in immune competent animals. Therefore, probiotics could prove an important therapeutic option for use in the management of newborns at high risk for developing intestinal infections and inflammatory disorders, including those cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit.

N2  - Flooding, extreme rainfall causing increased runoff and washing of faecal material into potable water, and warmer water temperatures are associated with increased transmission of waterborne diseases such as cholera, cryptosporidiosis, leptospirosis and the spread of harmful algal blooms. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) offers an opportunity for studying how unusual weather patterns affect the incidence of infectious diseases in general and, specifically, of water-related health threats. The ENSO-induced changes appear to increase the incidence of several infectious diseases, including hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, malaria, cholera, and Rift Valley fever. Weather and environmental parameter monitoring on a large scale from space offers the opportunity to predict and thus prevent the so-called 'climate sensitive' waterborne diseases. Recently space technology has been applied to: (1) predict cholera epidemics by monitoring sea surface temperature and sea surface height via earth observing satellites; (2) predict Rift Valley fever outbreaks up to five months in advance in East Africa using Pacific and Indian Ocean sea surface temperature anomalies coupled with satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data; (3) track algal blooms from space. Improvements such as higher spatial and spectral resolution, more frequent coverage and lower costs will provide new opportunities to extend the uses of remote sensing technology beyond a few vector-borne diseases to studies of waterborne and soil-borne and the mapping of human settlements at risk. The next generation of earth-observing remote sensing systems will also allow investigators in the human health community to characterize an increasing range of variables that are key to understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of the risk of disease transmission. These improved capabilities, when combined with the increased computing power and spatial modelling capabilities of geographic information systems, should extend the scope of remote sensing to include operational disease surveillance and control.

N2  - In recent years earth observation technology has been used to improve risk mapping for communicable diseases. Advances in satellite-based remote sensing and global positioning, in geographic information systems and computer processing now make it easier to integrate ecological, environmental and other data, to develop predictive models that can be used in disease surveillance and control activities. This enables experts to make more informed decisions that affect the lives of human and livestock, the environment, and the economy. Earth observation satellites offer a translational global platform for collecting data on vector-borne diseases which spread irrespective of national frontiers. Meteorological satellite data may also be used to identify epidemic-prone areas. Moreover, space-based observations complemented by ground-based observations are well suited to monitoring different manifestations of climate change and the factors to contributing to it. However, the capabilities of remote sensing technology have not been fully disseminated to the health investigators and agencies that could be using them. All health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDG)s, namely: (i) MDG 6 - HIV/AIDS, malaria and other infectious diseases; (ii) MDG4 - child mortality and, (iii) MDG5 - maternal health, are directly or indirectly related to infectious diseases. In view of this fact, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs through its Space Applications Programme and in cooperation with relevant UN organizations, space agencies and national health institutions has been organizing number of workshops and expert group meetings in various geographical regions to address how space technology can contribute to the achievement of the health-related MDGs. The prime objective of the Symposium is to promote awareness of the use of space technology applied to health care and review benefits for such applications as tele-health/tele-epidemiology.

N2  - Objectives: Several outbreaks of hepatitis A affecting homosexual men have been reported in Europe. However, the prevalence of HIV infection in patients affected by hepatitis A has not been studied and hepatitis A is not considered as an indicative disease for routine HIV testing. Method(s): We retrospectively identified all adult cases of acute hepatitis A, reported by the National Institute of Infectious Disease "L. Spallanzani", Rome-Italy, in 2002-2008. Age, gender, exposure to faecal/oral risk factors, intravenous drug use (IVDU) and sexual behaviours, were collected from clinical charts and the standard questionnaire of the Local Health Unit. Linkage with HIV laboratory records was also performed. Chi-square test for proportion was used. Result(s): We analyzed a total of 473 cases of hepatitis A, 368 (77.2%) males, accounting for the 75% of all reported cases in Rome aged 25-64 years (same gender distribution). Male-to-female ratio (M:F) was always above 2.4, except in 2006. Among female patient HIV serology was available for 15/105, and only one resulted HIV-positive. Among males patients HIV serology was available for 203/368 (55.2%) and 56 were positive; thus the minimum estimate of HIV prevalence among males was 15.2% (56/368). Among HIV+ patients, 12/56 discovered their infection concurrently with hepatitis A (3 primary HIV infections). Nine additional patients resulted HIV+ six months to six years after hepatitis A. HIV serological status among male patients according to patients' characteristics is shown in tables. Conclusion(s): High prevalence of HIV was found among male patients with hepatitis A in the period 2002-2008, except for 2006. HIV prevalence was higher among males reporting same gender sex, but was still above 5% for those not reporting same gender sex. Our data suggest that in areas with (M:F)>2, all adult males cases of acute hepatitis A should be routinely tested for HIV. (Table Presented).

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to utilize the novel frontier analysis to search for optimal strategy of vaccination policy against infectious diseases with limited vaccine supply. METHOD(S): An important goal of public health research is to predict clinical impact by nation-wide mass vaccination in preventing infectious diseases. Vaccination is usually given across potential vulnerable populations such as children. However, due to limited resources provided by the government among a growing number of competing vaccine products, some vaccinations are to be given to some targeted high-risk cohorts against infectious diseases, such as pneumonia or infl uenza. Hence, the optimal strategy of vaccination policy for effective disease control becomes a practical concern. We propose a model using frontier analysis to seek the optimal vaccination policy in controlling infectious disease epidemics with limited resources. The problem is initially formulated to fi nd the maximal life years gained while minimizing the variance. Various vaccination policies were explored in fi nding the optimal vaccination strategy. The indirect effects on unvaccinated cohorts were also considered in the analysis. The technique is illustrated using pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in Taiwan as an example. RESULT(S): Using the empirical study of PCV and various scenarios of the policy with limited resource, we provide the best vaccination strategy among various defi ned cohorts and report the maximal life years gained with the fi xed total cost of the vaccine given. Our study can be generalized to the optimization of vaccination strategies for most infectious diseases among different population structures. CONCLUSION(S): When disease burden is high, more emphasis should be laid on the possible health benefi ts gained with a vaccination program, instead of just considering the economic benefi ts. Our study can help to guide decision makers in determining optimal uses of limited quantities of vaccine across multiple targeted cohorts to effectively control infectious diseases.

N2  - Bacterial antibiotic resistance has emerged as an important factor influencing patient mortality and morbidity. Although the clinical impact of resistant bacteria is not fully known, studies have demonstrated an association between bacterial resistance to therapeutic antibiotic agents and worse patient outcomes (1, 2). It has been argued that without effective treatment and prevention of bacterial infections, we risk rolling back important achievements of modern medicine such as major surgery, organ transplantation and cancer chemotherapy (3). The Nordic countries are usually considered as low endemic countries with respect to prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the community. The reason for this is not entirely clear, but it has often been attributed to good standards of living and basic hygiene, low non-prescribed antibiotic usage and modern health care facilities. However, recent data indicate a rising resistance to quinolones and third generation cepalosporins among Enterobacteriacae and the prevalence of MRSA is also rising in the community (4). The rising rates of resistant bacteria in the general population increases the risk of significant outbreaks caused by multi-resistant pathogens among patients admitted to hospitals. The explosive nature of such an outbreak can be illustrated by the recent rapid increase in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae associated with significant morbidity and mortality in the Eastern Mediterranean region (5, 6).Intensive care units (ICUs) are high-risk environments for emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. Numerous factors contribute to this risk. Antibiotic treatment is regular in the ICU with a mean use of 1.25 defined daily doses per admission in a recent European survey (7). Regular use may promote emergence of resistance, because antimicrobial pressure is an important driver of resistance, particularly for Gram-negative bacteria. Identification of infectious complications is difficult in the critically ill; this may lead to inappropriate antibiotic treatment of conditions that lack a clinical indication for antibiotics. The potential for worse outcomes for critically ill patients whose initial empirical therapy is not adequate against infecting pathogens has led to increased use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Extended antibiotic treatment courses due to complex patient cases add further to the high antimicrobial pressure. Many infections in the ICU are related to invasive devices (i.e. central venous catheters, endo-tracheal tubes, urinary catheters) which are increasingly used. Other important factors are shortage in staffing and isolation rooms that may hinder appropriate cohort care and isolation in single rooms. Frequent lapses in healthcare workers attention to basic hygiene routines is also a major cause of transmission of bacteria in ICUs. The ICU is not an isolated clinical area, but rather exists, and provides a key clinical service, in a health-care environment that often fails to adequately prevent and control health-care associated infection. The microbiology of the ICU reflects the difficulties elsewhere in the hospital, the health service generally and in the community. Yet, much can be done within the ICU itself to hold down transmission and emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Basic hygiene. Failures in compliance to hygiene routines are a major cause of transmission of bacteria in ICUs. Such transmission can be avoided with uniform use of basic hygiene precautions applied to patients and staff, including physicians. A dress code with short sleeves for all health-care workers must be practiced. It is essential that ICU leaders make hand hygiene a priority, banning the wearing of finger rings, wrist jewelry and watches at work. The use of alcohol-based hand rub before and after every patient, and the use of gowns with every close contact must become a ritual, virtually religious behavior (8). The ICU environment. The inanimate hospital environment has resurfaced as an area for concern. Environmental surfaces are frequently contaminated with pathogens such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Clostridium difficile (9). Healthcare workers can contaminate their hands after touching these surfaces and transfer potential pathogens to a patient or another environmental site. The frequent shuttling of VRE between contaminated environmental sites and patients, via staff member's hands, helps to explain how quickly VRE has become a prominent nosocomial pathogen (10). Improved cleaning and lowering of contamination rates after a multifaceted intervention program (11), suggests that surface contamination is due to a failure to clean rather than to a faulty cleaning procedure or product. Thus, to minimize contributions of environmental spread of antibiotic- resistant bacteria, ICU leaders should insist that the performance of the cleaning staff is reviewed routinely. Invasive devices. Prevention of device-related infections should be a major focus for control of antibiotic resistance in ICUs. Judicious utilization of invasive devices (i.e. intravascular catheters for monitoring and treatment, invasive ventilation, urinary catheters) is a first measure that must be followed by preventive interventions. Most of these preventive interventions depend on persistent application of low-technology measures such as, in the case of central venous catheters, hand washing, full-barrier precautions during the insertion of catheters, cleaning the skin with chlorhexidine, avoiding the femoral site and removing unnecessary catheters (12). There are also multiple opportunities for improvement in central venous catheter postinsertion care (13). Staffing and facilities. Overcrowding and understaffing are associated with transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria. High workload and cramped working conditions lead to failure via decreased health-care worker hand-hygiene compliance, increased movement of patients and staff, less cohorting, and overburdening of screening and isolation facilities (14). In turn, a high incidence of infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria leads to increased inpatient length of stay and bed blocking, exacerbating overcrowding and creating a vicious cycle characterised by further infection control failure. Strict adherence to guidelines and recommendations for facilities (floor space per bed) and nursing staff levels (patient-nurse ratio) for critical care will reduce the risk for cross-transmission. Diagnosis of infections. Rapid turnaround of diagnostic cultures and tests, such us procalcitonin, may reduce the need for antibiotics, shorten the length of treatment and promote specific instead of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Novel and rapid nucleic acid-based diagnostic tests to detect bacteria (PCR) may help to use isolation facilities more effectively by identifying multi-resistance earlier. Antibiotic use. Physicians are not prescribing antibiotics properly. Studies indicate that hospital physicians may be unaware of the benefits and risks of prescribing antibiotics including whether to prescribe an antibiotic, which antibiotic to prescribe, at what dose and for how long; findings that also in part apply to ICUs (7). Many different methods to improve the prescribing of antibiotics in hospitals have been studied. Restrictive methods (i.e. expert approval before use, removal/ restriction of certain antibiotics, cycling/rotation of antibiotics, automatic stop-order) have a greater short term impact than educational methods (i.e. general education, guidelines, recommendations, opinion leaders), but little is known as to the long-term effects (15). Computer-assisted microbial prescription systems with a mixed educational and restrictive approach may improve usage of antibiotics without increasing adverse outcomes (16). Audit and surveillance. A continuous audit of antimicrobial consumption and local resistance patterns with feedback to prescribers is an important way to promote rational treatment (17). Regular information on local and regional resistance patterns together with a proactive surveillance approach, the practice of performing active surveillance cultures to identify patients colonized with resistant bacteria, may help to identify emerging resistance as well as patients with MRSA, VRE and other antimicrobial resistance patterns. We practice medicine in an era when airlines carry more than two billion passengers annually, which gives ample opportunities for spread of bacteria and their resistance genes in our communities (18). Although the Nordic region is currently a low endemic region when it comes to multi-resistant bacteria this may change rapidly. To ra region with low resistance rates in the health-care sector we must have a high level of awareness and promote sound routines and procedures.

N2  - Background: Dengue virus is the most important arbovirus in the world; its range is expanding. Like WNV, dengue is transmitted naturally by the bite of an infected mosquito but also is transfusion transmitted. Data from 2005 in Puerto Rico (PR ), a dengue-endemic area, demonstrated a rate of donor viremia of 1:1300 during the latter half of the 2005 epidemic season. In 2007, a much larger dengue outbreak occurred in PR from which samples from donors during the epidemic period were retained for testing to further confirm donor viremia rates and for recipient tracing of components from positive donations. Method(s): Samples were retained in a repository and split into two sets for viremia studies: those units exported and transfused in the continental US and those transfused in PR. Samples were tested individually by a research transcription mediated amplification assay (TMA, Gen-Probe). Initially reactive (IR ) samples were retested by the original TMA and an alternate TMA (alt TMA used for the units transfused in PR only) without dilution and at a 1:16 dilution to model pooling. All TMA -repeat reactive (RR ) samples were considered confirmed. Additional virologic/infectivity and serologic testing was performed at the CDC dengue branch in PR including PCR to define the dengue serotype and viral load, mosquito cell culture and IgM testing. Hospitals receiving components from RR donations were contacted to initiate recipient tracing including a detailed questionnaire about symptoms and risk factors. The study was IRB approved. Result(s): A total of 15,350 samples were tested with 28 IR and 25 RR samples considered confirmed positive (pos) for a prevalence of 1:614 consisting of 12 dengue-pos donations exported from PR into the continental US (1:533) and 13 pos donations that remained in PR (1:689). Specificity was 99.98%. A 1:16 dilution detected 14/25 (56%) RR donations. Further supplemental testing (CDC) demonstrated dengue virus serotypes 1, 2 and 3 (corresponding to those circulating in PR ); 11 /25 (44%) samples had RNA titers of 10^5-10^9 copies/mL of which all 11 also infected C636 mosquito cell cultures. 9/11 (82%) PCR -pos samples were detected at a 1:16 dilution. 6/22 (27%) samples tested for IgM were pos, only 2 of which had quantifiable virus (10^6 and 10^8) with 1 detected at a 1:16 dilution. Of the 4 remaining IgM pos samples, only 1 was pos at a 1:16 dilution (low level pos) for a total of 2 IgM-pos samples detected when diluted. Recipient tracing in the continental US and PR is underway. Conclusion(s): Like the prior study identifying dengue viremic donations in PR, this study demonstrates a high frequency of viremia during dengueepidemic periods with nearly half of the RNA -pos donations lacking IgM, having high-titer viremia and infectious in cell culture. Screening of donors should be considered during dengue-epidemic periods.

N2  - To effectively control infectious diseases, great efforts have been made using empirical and theoretical approaches to explore the age-related characteristics of various infectious diseases, such as the force of infection (FOI), the per capita rate that a susceptible from a certain age is infected. Among them, mathematical epidemic models have contributed greatly to the control of infection within population. With the relaxed assumption of impractical unlimited vaccine supply, we developed a generalized methodology based on dynamic stochastic model utilizing the flow of limited vaccine supply to the individuals between two mutually exclusive subgroups (e.g. different age groups or different risk groups) in order to examine the long term impact of different vaccination programs on overall health outcomes from the whole population. In this model, both age dependency and seasonality in FOI were explicitly considered. This study aims to answer two key questions: 1) what is the best vaccination strategy in order to attain maximal quantitative post-vaccination health benefits among two subpopulations? and 2) how different structures of age-specific FOI's influence our selection on the vaccinated population? Most of the time, one needs to have various parameter values in the models targeting spreading of infectious diseases in populations which cannot be estimated accurately. Therefore, a series of scenarios with different FOI's, demographic structures, vaccine efficacy and other model parameters were used in our simulation studies using this stochastic age-structured framework. In summary, our study dynamically acquired both important biomedical and mathematical implications by successfully analyzing the current mass vaccination strategy, evaluating the effect of different prevention and intervention options, and served as an accurate basis for outcome research that may facilitate further cost-effectiveness analysis.

N2  - Background: Ethnic minorities in Europe such as the Chinese may need a special strategy with regard to risk communication about emerging infectious diseases. To engage them in precautionary actions, it is important to know their information sources, knowledge, and health beliefs. Purpose(s): This study's purpose is to study the use of information sources, knowledge, and health beliefs related to SARS and avian flu of Chinese people in the UK and The Netherlands, and to make comparisons with the general population in these countries. Method(s): Results of a self-administered questionnaire among 300 British/Dutch Chinese were compared to data obtained from a computer-assisted phone survey among the general population (n=800). Result(s): British/Dutch Chinese got most information about emerging diseases from family and friends, followed by Chinese media and British/Dutch TV. They had less confidence than general groups in their doctor, government agencies, and consumer/patient interest groups. Their knowledge of SARS was high. They had a lower perceived threat than general populations with regard to SARS and avian flu due to a lower perceived severity. They had higher self-efficacy beliefs regarding SARS and avian flu. Conclusion(s): In case of new outbreaks of SARS/avian flu in China, local authorities in the UK and The Netherlands can best reach Chinese people through informal networks and British/Dutch TV, while trying to improve confidence in information from the government. In communications, the severity of the disease rather than the susceptibility appears to need most attention. © 2009 International Society of Behavioral Medicine.

N2  - Purpose: To study the levels of perceived threat, perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, response efficacy, and self-efficacy for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and eight other diseases in five European and three Asian countries. Method(s): A computer-assisted phone survey was conducted among 3,436 respondents. The questionnaire focused on perceived threat, vulnerability, severity, response efficacy, and self-efficacy related to SARS and eight other diseases. Result(s): Perceived threat of SARS in case of an outbreak in the country was higher than that of other diseases. Perceived vulnerability of SARS was at an intermediate level and perceived severity was high compared to other diseases. Perceived threat for SARS varied between countries in Europe and Asia with a higher perceived severity of SARS in Europe and a higher perceived vulnerability in Asia. Response efficacy and self-efficacy for SARS were higher in Asia compared to Europe. In multiple linear regression analyses, country was strongly associated with perceived threat. Conclusion(s): The relatively high perceived threat for SARS indicates that it is seen as a public health risk and offers a basis for communication in case of an outbreak. The strong association between perceived threat and country and different regional patterns require further research. © 2009 International Society of Behavioral Medicine.

T1  - Modeling the effect of information quality on risk behavior change and the transmission of infectious diseases
A1  - Chen F.H. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - How the quality of information about the prevalence of an infectious disease affects individuals' incentives to adopt self-protective actions to reduce the risk of infection is studied using an economic/game-theoretic model of epidemics. In the model, agents make inferences regarding the current prevalence of a disease by observing the health status of a subset of the population. Therefore, the higher the number of agents whose infection status can be observed, the better one's information about the current prevalence is. In particular, it is assumed that an agent's estimate of the current prevalence depends on observations of the current health status of other agents and on the agent's estimate of past prevalence, and that the agent places more weight on the current observations in forming an estimate of the prevailing prevalence when the number of observations increases. It is shown that the likelihood of eradicating an infectious disease through behavioral changes depends critically on the amount of information that individuals have access to, which also determines whether prevalence will be relatively stable or will exhibit cyclical patterns over time. Increasing the amount of information that individuals possess may lower the likelihood of eradication. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - A metapopulation model for the spread and persistence of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) in African sedentary mixed crop-livestock systems
A1  - Ezanno P.
A1  - Lesnoff M. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is endemic in several developing countries. Our objective is to evaluate the regional CBPP spread and persistence in a mixed crop-livestock system in Africa. A stochastic compartmental model in metapopulation is used, in which between-herd animal movements and the within-herd infection dynamics are explicitly represented. Hundred herds of varying size are modelled, each sending animals to n other herds (network degree). Animals are susceptible, latent, infectious, chronic carrier or resistant. The role of chronic carriers in CBPP spread being still debated, several chronic periods and infectiousness are tested. A sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the influence on model outputs of these parameters and of pathogen virulence, between-herd movement rate, network degree, and calves recruitment. Model outputs are the probability that individual- and group-level reproductive numbers R0 and R* are above one, the metapopulation infection duration, the probability of CBPP endemicity (when CBPP persists over 5 years), and the epidemic size in infected herds and infected animals. The most influential parameters are related to chronic carriers (infectiousness and chronic period), pathogen virulence, and recruitment rate. When assuming no CBPP re-introduction in the region, endemicity is only probable if chronic carriers are assumed infectious for at least 1 year and to shed the pathogen in not too low an amount. It becomes highly probable when assuming high pathogen virulence and high recruitment rate. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objectives In countries with both TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics, HIV is known to be the most powerful risk factor for death during tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Few recent studies have evaluated risk factors for death among HIV-uninfected TB patients in these countries. We analysed data from a multi-province demonstration project in Thailand to answer this question. Method We prospectively collected data from HIV-uninfected TB patients treated for TB in four provinces and the national infectious diseases hospital in Thailand from 2004-2006. Standard WHO definitions were used to classify treatment outcomes. We used log-binomial multivariate regression to calculate adjusted relative risk (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for factors associated with death. Results Of 5318 cases, 441 (8%) died during TB treatment. The mean age was 47 years (range 8 months-97 years). Multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB was diagnosed in 62 (1%). In multivariate analysis, patients older than 44 years were significantly more likely to die than patients aged 15-44 years [age 45-64, aRR 2.9 (CI 2.2-3.8)] [age > 64 years, aRR 5.0 (CI 3.9-6.6)]. Other independent risk factors for death included Thai nationality [aRR 3.9 (CI 1.6-9.5)], MDR-TB [aRR 2.8 (CI 1.7-4.8)], not being married [aRR 1.4 (CI 1.2-1.7)], and living in Chiang Rai province [aRR 2.7 (CI 1.7-4.4)]. Conclusions The death rate was high among HIV-uninfected TB patients in Thailand. Efforts to improve TB diagnosis and treatment in the elderly and to improve MDR-TB treatment may help reduce mortality. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Background. In 2007, a US Air Force training facility reported a cluster of severe respiratory illnesses associated with a rare human adenovirus (Ad) serotype, Ad14. We investigated this outbreak to better understand its epidemiology, clinical spectrum, and associated risk factors. Methods. Data were collected from ongoing febrile respiratory illness (FRI) surveillance and from a retrospective cohort investigation. Because an Ad7 vaccine is in development, Ad7 antibody titers in pretraining serum samples from trainees with mild and those with severe Ad14 illness were compared. Results. During 2007, an estimated 551 (48%) of 1147 trainees with FRI were infected with Ad14; 23 were hospitalized with pneumonia, 4 required admission to an intensive care unit, and 1 died. Among cohort members (n = 173), the Ad14 infection rate was high (50%). Of those infected, 40% experienced FRI.Nocohort members were hospitalized. Male sex (risk ratio [RR], 4.7 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.2-10.1]) and an ill close contact (RR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.2-2.2]) were associated with infection. Preexisting Ad7 neutralizing antibodies were found in 7 (37%) of 19 Ad14-positive trainees with mild illness but in 0 of 16 trainees with Ad14 pneumonia (P = .007). Conclusions. Emergence of Ad14, a rare Ad serotype, caused a protracted outbreak of respiratory illness among military recruits. Most infected recruits experienced FRI or milder illnesses. Some required hospitalization, and 1 died. Natural Ad7 infection may protect against severe Ad14 illness. © 2009 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

N2  - Background. Information on the onset of epidemics of acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) is useful in timing preventive strategies (eg, the passive immunization of high-risk infants against respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]). Aiming at better predictions of the seasonal activity of ARI pathogens, we investigated the influence of climate on hospitalizations for ARIs. Methods. Samples obtained from 3044 children hospitalized with ARIs in Mainz, Germany, were tested for pathogens with a multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from 2001 through 2006. Hospitalizations for ARIs were correlated with meteorological parameters recorded at the University of Mainz. The frequency of hospitalization for RSV infection was predicted on the basis of multiple time series analysis. Results. Influenza A, RSV, and adenovirus were correlated with temperature and rhinovirus to relative humidity. In a time series model that included seasonal and climatic conditions, RSV-associated hospitalizations were predictable. Conclusions. Seasonality of certain ARI pathogens can be explained by meteorological influences. The model presented herein is a first step toward predicting annual RSV epidemics using weather forecast data. © 2009 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

T1  - Hepatitis B vaccination and changes in sexual risk behaviour among men who have sex with men in Amsterdam

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - The impact of hepatitis B vaccination in men having sex with men in Amsterdam has been marginal until now, possibly because of increases in sexual risk behaviour counterbalancing the effect of vaccination. A mathematical model is used to describe the hepatitis B epidemic. The model shows that, with the current vaccination coverage, the decrease in incidence is small in the beginning. However, the number of infections prevented per vaccine administered rises over time. Nevertheless, increased risk behaviour reduces the benefit of vaccination. Targeting high-risk men is more successful in reducing and containing the epidemic than targeting low-risk men. In conclusion, the vaccination campaign is effective and should be intensified. High-risk men should be targeted for vaccination and for risk reduction. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.

N2  - Background: Adenovirus type 3 (HAdV3) is one of the most prevalent serotypes detected globally. Variants of HAdV3 have been associated with outbreaks of severe disease. Objective(s): To better understand genetic diversity of circulating HAdV3s and examine risk factors for severe disease. Study design: Restriction enzyme analysis for genomic characterization of clinical HAdV3 isolates detected by 15 collaborative US laboratories during the period July 2004 to May 2007. Multivariate modeling was employed for statistical analyses. Result(s): The most common HAdV3 types of 516 isolates studied were HAdV3a2 (36.9%), HAdV3a50 (27.1%), HAdV3a51 (18.0%), and HAdV3a17 (4.6%). Non-HAdV3a genome types were rare (1.2%). HAdV3a50 and HAdV3a51 are newly described variants which became more prevalent in 2006 and 2007 and have been associated with at least one epidemic. Their uniqueness was determined by specific banding profiles generated by digests with endonucleases BclI, BglII, and HindIII. Multivariable risk factor modeling demonstrated that children under 2 years of age (OR = 2.7; 95%CI 1.6-4.6), persons with chronic disease (OR = 5.1; 95%CI 2.6-9.8), persons infected with HAdV3a2 (OR = 3.0; 95%CI 1.5-6.0), with HAdV3a50 (OR = 2.5; 95%CI 1.2-5.2), or with multiple or rare strains (OR = 2.8; 95%CI 1.3-6.5) were at increased risk of severe HAdV3 clinical disease. Conclusion(s): In the study period considerable genetic diversity was found among US clinical HAdV3 strains. Novel variants emerged and became prevalent. One such emergent strain may be associated with more severe clinical disease. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T1  - Stockpile of personal protective equipment in hospital settings: Preparedness for influenza pandemics
A1  - Hashikura M.
A1  - Kizu J. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Background: Personal protective equipment (PPE) is known to be a crucial means of preventing influenza pandemics; however, the amount of PPE that should be stored in hospital settings has been unclear. Objective(s): The purpose of this paper is to propose a PPE calculation system to help hospitals to decide their PPE stockpile. Method(s): We searched influenza guidelines from a number of countries and research papers on protective devices and infectious diseases. The PPE calculation system included factors such as the influenza pandemic period, risk classification by health care workers (HCW) type, and the type and number of PPE for a HCW per day. Result(s): We concluded that 4 sets of PPE (N95 respirators, double gloves, gowns, and goggles) per day should be prepared for HCWs in a high-risk group. Similarly, 2 sets of appropriate PPE, depending on the risk level, are required for medium- and low-risk groups. In addition, 2 surgical masks are required for every worker and inpatient and 1 for each outpatient. The PPE stockpile should be prepared to cover at least an 8-week pandemic. Conclusion(s): Purchasing a PPE stockpile requires a sizable budget. The PPE calculation system in this paper will hopefully support hospitals in deciding their PPE stockpile. © 2009 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

T1  - Dynamic phenomena arising from an extended Core Group model
A1  - Greenhalgh D.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - In order to obtain a reasonably accurate model for the spread of a particular infectious disease through a population, it may be necessary for this model to possess some degree of structural complexity. Many such models have, in recent years, been found to exhibit a phenomenon known as backward bifurcation, which generally implies the existence of two subcritical endemic equilibria. It is often possible to refine these models yet further, and we investigate here the influence such a refinement may have on the dynamic behaviour of a system in the region of the parameter space near R0 = 1. We consider a natural extension to a so-called Core Group model for the spread of a sexually transmitted disease, arguing that this may in fact give rise to a more realistic model. From the deterministic viewpoint we study the possible shapes of the resulting bifurcation diagrams and the associated stability patterns. Stochastic versions of both the original and the extended models are also developed so that the probability of extinction and time to extinction may be examined, allowing us to gain further insights into the complex system dynamics near R0 = 1. A number of interesting phenomena are observed, for which heuristic explanations are provided. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - This study investigated the risk factors associated with recent and chronic HIV infections among individual attending a voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) site in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In a cross-sectional study, recent HIV infections were detected by the sensitive/less-sensitive test, using Serologic Testing Algorithm for Recent HIV Seroconversion (STARHS) strategy, and compared to chronic HIV infection and HIV negative individuals. Seroincidence was estimated and risk factors associated with recent and chronic infections were assessed using multinomial logistic regression. Among the 7,379 individuals tested between June 2006 and April 2007, the overall prevalence and incidence of HIV infection were 7.5%; and 1.39/100 PY, respectively. In multivariate analysis, having a HIV positive steady partner was a risk factor for recent and for chronic HIV infection for MSM, heterosexual male and women. No differences in risk factors for recent and chronic infections were found between MSM and heterosexual males. Among women, chronic infected individuals were more likely than HIV negatives to be older. Recently HIV infected women were more likely than HIV negatives to be less educated; and more likely than HIV negatives and chronically infected to report having more partners. Routinely used risk-based assessment in testing centers in Brazil lack sensitivity to distinguish between recent and chronic infections, particularly among MSM and heterosexual males. Steady relationships and serosorting may be playing a key role in maintaining the HIV epidemics in Brazil. © 2009 by The Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases and Contexto Publishing.

N2  - Estimating the potential health benefits and expenditures of a partially effective HIV vaccine is an important consideration in the debate about whether HIV vaccine research should continue. We developed an epidemic model to estimate HIV prevalence, new infections, and the cost-effectiveness of vaccination strategies in the U.S. Vaccines with modest efficacy could prevent 300,000-700,000 HIV infections and save $30 billion in healthcare expenditures over 20 years. Targeted vaccination of high-risk individuals is economically efficient, but difficulty in reaching these groups may mitigate these benefits. Universal vaccination is cost-effective for vaccines with 50% efficacy and price similar to other infectious disease vaccines. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The occurrence of asymptomatic penetration of certain infectious agents in blood presents a risk of transmission of one of these agents during blood transfusion. Although well controlled for some infectious agents (HIV, HTLV, HCV, HBV), this risk is nevertheless neither documented nor quantified for other pathogens that are responsible for serologically unscreened or undetectable infections at the time of blood donation. This risk is generally low in endemic situations, although it increases for particular time periods and locations when clustered cases or outbreaks occur. Prevention measures may then be implemented (interruption of blood collection, quarantined donations, etc.). These measures can have an important impact, particularly by limiting the supply of blood products to health care facilities. It is therefore important for these measures to be adapted to the risk of transmission through blood transfusion. Quantitative risk estimates of blood donation contamination can therefore contribute to guiding those measures. In this context, in early 2005, the French Public Health Institute (InVS) started a project with the aim of obtaining a priori quantitative risk estimates of contamination of a blood donation by infectious agents for various scenarios in terms of incidence and time-space distribution. The objective of this article is to update the last estimates of residual risks of the major transfusion-transmitted viral infections (HIV, HTLV, HCV and HBV) and to present the work realized by the working group <>. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - Introduction: The influenza pandemics of the 20th century, the SARS epidemic in 2002 / 03 and the growing number of human cases infected with the H5N1 avian infl uenza virus clearly demonstrate that the threat of new pandemics is very real. These events have intensifi ed pandemic prevention and control activities worldwide. " SARSControl " is a three-year project funded by the European Commission with the objective to aid European member states in the public health management of new emerging infections. This article summarises the main research results and recommendations arising from this project. Method(s): The reports and papers published in the SARSControl project form the basis of this article. In addition, a literature search for SARS and pandemic infl uenza was conducted and information on pandemic planning and management guidelines obtained from the WHO and EU websites. The project results are discussed in this context. Result(s): A lack of knowledge and delayed international communication resulted in the rapid spread of SARS, highlighting the importance of a global system for rapid and transparent information transfer. Epidemiological and economic modelling studies have shown that, in comparison to travel restrictions, applying intervention measures to interrupt local transmission within a country and investing into vaccine research and anti-viral stockpiling, is a more cost-eff ective and effi cient use of resources for the containment of pandemics. A study investigating the perceived threat associated with pandemics showed that the subjective risk perception of people varies among countries. This infl uences human behaviour and should hence be considered during risk communication and implementation of pandemic control measures. Discussion(s): The basic prerequistes of an effi cient pandemic management are operationalisable pandemic plans, subjected to regular exercises, backed by adequate resources and a sound health-care infrastructure. At international level cross-border co-operation and information exchange on infection control is the key to pandemic mitigation and containment. Strengthening surveillance systems at the international level, to allow the timely monitoring of infectious agents and outbreaks is essen tial. Transferring such outbreak information in real time into mathematical models and the resulting essential epidemiological information to policy makers would facilitate a more effi cient use of scarce resources. Involvement of the public in decisions regarding the implementation of restrictive control measures which often curtail individual liberty is necessary for the acceptance and ultimate success of pandemic control. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

N2  - Geographical maps indicating the value of the basic reproduction number, R0, can be used to identify areas of higher risk for an outbreak after an introduction. We develop a methodology to create R0 maps for vector-borne diseases, using bluetongue virus as a case study. This method provides a tool for gauging the extent of environmental effects on disease emergence. The method involves integrating vector-abundance data with statistical approaches to predict abundance from satellite imagery and with the biologically mechanistic modelling that underlies R0. We illustrate the method with three applications for bluetongue virus in the Netherlands: 1) a simple R0 map for the situation in September 2006, 2) species-specific R0 maps based on satellite-data derived predictions, and 3) monthly R0 maps throughout the year. These applications ought to be considered as a proof-of-principle and illustrations of the methods described, rather than as ready-to-use risk maps. Altogether, this is a first step towards an integrative method to predict risk of establishment of diseases based on mathematical modelling combined with a geographic information system that may comprise climatic variables, landscape features, land use, and other relevant factors determining the risk of establishment for bluetongue as well as of other emerging vector-borne diseases. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - As a model for aerosol transmission, chicken feces was spiked with avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H10N7 and used to generate a fine particulate matter aerosol. For this an innovative aerosol chamber was developed, that collected PM2.5 on quartz microfiber filters. With AIV contaminated PM2.5 dust-coated filters different incubation times ranging from 0 to 4 days and storage mainly at +4 and +20 degreeC and at different relative humidity (RH) were performed. Embryonic death in inoculated hen's eggs with filter elute was the AIV infectivity read out. To determine viral genome presence quantitative real time RT-PCR was applied. The filter elutes contained AIV genome as well as viable virus whereby +20 degreeC indicated a borderline temperature for infectious virus stability. In addition, high relative humidity was critical for AIV viability in PM2.5. The results allowed a dispersion calculation of infectious AIV in aerosols assuming a worst case scenario for an AIV outbreak in poultry farms. Thus exposure to AIV associated with PM2.5 is possible near to infected farms and may be a serious risk for fatal influenza disease in both man and animals. Airborne transmission should be effectively preventable by dispersion of water combined with disinfection into the inside air as well as the exhaust air stream of AIV infected farms. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - In this paper the optimal control strategies of an SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) epidemic model with time delay are introduced. In order to do this, we consider an optimally controlled SIR epidemic model with time delay where a control means treatment for infectious hosts. We use optimal control approach to minimize the probability that the infected individuals spread and to maximize the total number of susceptible and recovered individuals. We first derive the basic reproduction number and investigate the dynamical behavior of the controlled SIR epidemic model. We also show the existence of an optimal control for the control system and present numerical simulations on real data regarding the course of Ebola virus in Congo. Our results indicate that a small contact rate(probability of infection) is suitable for eradication of the disease (Ebola virus) and this is one way of optimal treatment strategies for infectious hosts. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Background: Norovirus (NoV) is commonly associated with gastrointestinal infection. It is normally transmitted person-to-person or from contaminated surfaces, although food-borne transmission is possible. Method(s): We conducted environmental, epidemiological, and microbiological investigations to ascertain the route of transmission of two linked outbreaks of NoV associated with events where food was consumed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine food items independently associated with infection. Result(s): In outbreak A, 19 of the 26 people who completed the food questionnaire fulfilled the case definition. The highest relative risks (RR) were for chicken kebab (RR 3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-10.4), pork sausages (RR 2.1, 95% CI 0.5-9.1), pasta salad (RR 1.94, 95% CI 0.9-4.1), cheese (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9-2.8), and green leaf salad (RR 1.5, 95% CI 0.9-2.4). In outbreak B, 60 of the 106 people surveyed fulfilled the case definition. Green leaf salad (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.2, 95% CI 1.4-9.9) and coleslaw (aOR 8.2, 95% CI 3-22.2) were independently associated with illness in the multivariate logistic regression model. NoV genogroup II genotype 6 (GII-6) was identified in cases of both outbreaks and a food handler who had prepared salads for both events. Conclusion(s): Because outbreak investigations of small cohorts may not yield epidemiological association to food, most of these outbreaks may be attributed to the person-to-person transmission route. Therefore ascertainment of food-borne NoV infection may be low, underestimating the true prevalence of this route of transmission. © 2008 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

N2  - Objective People who live under fragile living conditions may stay overnight in Internet cafes in urban areas. An outbreak of tuberculosis (TB), the routes of which were possibly related to such a facility, has been reported. The purpose of this study was to use a mathematical model to quantify the public health risk of TB infection in such a facility. Methods The reproduction number for airborne infection in an enclosed space (RA) was estimated using a Wells- Riley model. First, we estimated RA for the TB infection based on the report of the TB outbreak in the Internet cafe. Second, TB infectious dose, number of days of exposure, and air-exchange rate in the facility were varied to estimate the effect of TB risk settings and environmental factors. Results We assumed that TB patients and 59 susceptible subjects stayed for 150 days in a room where the airexchange rate was five per hour. Using the estimated median RA of 44.14, the TB infection rate was 74.6%. This result was similar to the epidemiological report that the TB infection rate among employees in the Internet cafe was 70%. The median RA increased linearly as the number of days of exposure increased. The slope of the change in median RA divided by the change in the number of days of exposure increased exponentially as air-exchange rate decreased; thus air ventilation in a facility may be essential to prevent TB infection. Conclusions Appropriate air ventilation in facilities such as Internet cafes is needed as part of a TB-control program in metropolitan areas. © The Japanese Society for Hygiene 2009.

N2  - Background. It has been predicted that CD4 C868T, a novel CD4 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that has been found to be highly prevalent among Africans, changes the tertiary structure of CD4, which may alter susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Methods. Participants were from a Kenyan cohort and included 87 uninfected and 277 HIV-1-infected individuals. DNA sequencing was used to determine CD4 genotype. A2.01 cells expressing similar levels of either wild-type CD4 or CD4-Trp240 as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells from uninfected donors were infected with HIV-1IIIB or a Kenyan primary HIV-1 isolate. HIV-1 p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the outcome of infection. Results. CD4 C868T was found to be significantly more prevalent among HIV-1-infected participants than among HIV-1-uninfected participants (P = .002), and C868T was associated with an increased incidence of HIV-1 infection as well (P = .005, log-rank test; P = .009, Wilcoxon test), with an odds ratio of 2.49 (P = .009). Both in vitro and ex vivo models demonstrated a significant association between CD4 C868T and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection (P > .001 and P = .003, respectively). Conclusion. Overall, the present study found a strong correlation between CD4 C868T and increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Given the high prevalence of both HIV infection and CD4 C868T in African populations, the effect of this SNP on the epidemic in Africa could be dramatic. © 2009 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

T1  - Does exposure to infectious diseases in infancy affect old-age mortality? Evidence from a pre-industrial population
A1  - Gagnon A.
A1  - Mazan R. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Many studies have shown that health conditions experienced in childhood play an important role on an individual's adult mortality. Recent research suggests that past reductions in early life exposure to infectious diseases have been a major contributor to the historical decline in old-age mortality. Drawing on French-Canadian data from cohorts born in the 17th and 18th centuries, we test whether a progressive deterioration in early life conditions (as revealed by an increasing infant mortality rate) translates into a decrease in survival prospects in late life. We use traditional demographic measures such as the age-specific probability of death, and a series of proportional hazard models to control for familial and environmental conditions. Results point toward little evidence of any early life effects. The trend of increasing infant mortality does not correlate with a general increase of mortality in older ages within the same cohorts. Period changes affecting survival at older ages (war, epidemics) as well as demographic and biological characteristics shared within families have a much larger role in old-age mortality than early life characteristics shared within the same cohorts. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Investment decisions in influenza pandemic contingency planning: Cost-effectiveness of stockpiling antiviral drugs
A1  - Lugner A.K.
A1  - Postma M.J. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Background: The threat of an influenza pandemic has led to stockpiling of antiviral drugs in order to mitigate a plausible outbreak. If the stockpile would be used in relation to the recent pandemic alert, an investment decision about renewing the stock for a possible subsequent pandemic is essential. The decision should include cost-effectiveness considerations. Method(s): We constructed a cost-effectiveness analysis in the Dutch context, explicitly including risk of an outbreak. Outcomes from a dynamic transmission model, comparing an intervention with a non-intervention scenario, were input in our health economic calculations. Result(s): Stockpiling was cost-effective from the health-care perspective if the actual risk is 37 for 30 years. If less than 60 of the population would take the antiviral drugs or the attack rate is about 50, the investment would not be cost-effective from this perspective. Conclusion(s): Risk perception, realistic coverage among population and size of a pandemic are crucial parameters and highly decisive for the investment decision.

T1  - The origin and spread of a mumps epidemic: United Kingdom, 2003-2006
A1  - Jick H.
A1  - Chamberlin D.P.
A1  - Hagberg K.W. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The United Kingdom (UK) underwent a massive epidemic of mumps from 2003 through 2006. The origin and spread was mapped in 350 general practices that used office computers to contribute comprehensive medical information on approximately 3 million patients to the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). METHOD(S): The continuous 3-month cumulative incidence of mumps (2003-2006) was estimated by dividing the number of diagnosed cases of mumps each 3 months by the population at risk according to age, region, practice, and calendar time. The effect of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine was estimated by comparing vaccine exposure of those diagnosed with mumps and those who were not. RESULT(S): There were 5683 cases of mumps recorded in the Database over the 4-year time period. As the Database represents about 5% of the UK population, we estimate that there were more than 100,000 cases of mumps diagnosed in the UK during these 4 years. The epidemic appears to have started in one practice in Wales in the first 6 months of 2003 and then spread slowly north and east, reaching a peak in 2005. Young adults aged 18-24 years were at the highest risk. There were 3 major MMR vaccination campaigns (1988-1989, 1997, and 2004-2005) that by 2006 provided more than 70% protection against mumps in children younger than 18 years of age. Protection was higher in those who had received 2 doses of the vaccine. CONCLUSION(S): A comprehensive program of medical information generated by selected general practitioners has provided a sound basis for the real-time recording of the origin, spread, and scope of an infectious disease. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

T1  - Epidemic modelling: Aspects where stochasticity matters
A1  - Britton T.
A1  - Lindenstrand D. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Epidemic models are always simplifications of real world epidemics. Which real world features to include, and which simplifications to make, depend both on the disease of interest and on the purpose of the modelling. In the present paper we discuss some such purposes for which a stochastic model is preferable to a deterministic counterpart. The two main examples illustrate the importance of allowing the infectious and latent periods to be random when focus lies on the probability of a large epidemic outbreak and/or on the initial speed, or growth rate, of the epidemic. A consequence of the latter is that estimation of the basic reproduction number R0 is sensitive to assumptions about the distributions of the infectious and latent periods when using data from the early stages of an outbreak, which we illustrate with data from the H1N1 influenza A pandemic. Some further examples are also discussed as are some practical consequences related to these stochastic aspects. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background. Infection due to Salmonella species causes an estimated 1.4 million illnesses and 400 deaths annually in the United States. Orange juice is a known vehicle of salmonellosis, for which regulatory controls have recently been implemented. We investigated a nationwide outbreak of Salmonella infection to determine the magnitude of the outbreak and to identify risk factors for infection. Methods. We identified cases through national laboratory-based surveillance. In a case-control study, we defined a case as infection with Salmonella serotype Typhimurium that demonstrated the outbreak pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern in a person with illness onset from 1 May through 31 July 2005; control subjects were identified through random digit dialing. Results. We identified 152 cases in 23 states. Detailed information was available for 95 cases. The median age of patients was 23 years; 46 (48%) of the 95 patients were female. For 38 patients and 53 age-group matched control subjects in 5 states, illness was associated with consuming orange juice (90% vs. 43%; odds ratio, 22.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.5-927.5). In a conditional logistic regression model, illness was associated with consuming unpasteurized orange juice from company X (53% vs. 0%; odds ratio, 38.0; 95% confidence interval, 6.5-infinity). The US Food and Drug Administration found that company X was noncompliant with the juice Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point regulation and isolated Salmonella serotype Saintpaul from company X's orange juice. Conclusions. Unpasteurized orange juice from company X was the vehicle of a widespread outbreak of salmonellosis. Although the route of contamination is unknown, noncompliance with the juice Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point regulation likely contributed to this outbreak. Pasteurization or other reliable treatment of orange juice could prevent similar outbreaks. © 2009 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

T1  - Update on successes and challenges regarding mother-to-child transmission of HIV
A1  - Paintsil E.
A1  - Andiman W.A. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Purpose of review There is an unprecedented global commitment to reverse the pediatric HIV epidemic by making prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services accessible in all countries. This review outlines the successes made and the challenges that remain. Recent findings In resource-rich countries, mother-to-child transmission rates of HIV as low as 1% have been achieved. The efficacy of short-course antiretrovirals for PMTCT in Africa is estimated at 50%. Coinfections with herpes simplex virus type 2, other sexually transmitted infections resulting in genital ulcers, and endemic infectious diseases (e.g., malaria) may increase the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Vertical transmission of drug-resistant viruses has been reported; the prevalence and effect of transmitted resistant virus on treatment outcomes are under investigation. Obstacles facing PMTCT in resource-limited countries include the lack of healthcare infrastructure, limited manpower, and competing public health priorities with the limited healthcare budget. Summary Although the birth of an HIV-infected child in a resource-rich country is now a sentinel health event, in most resource-limited countries the birth of an HIV-infected child continues to be the status quo. Comprehensive PMTCT, including antiretroviral treatment for HIV-infected women and children, should be paramount in resource-limited countries. © 2009 Wolters Kluwer HealthLippincott Williams & Wilkins.

T1  - Dynamics and control of infections transmitted from person to person through the environment

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - The environment provides points for control of pathogens spread by food, water, hands, air, or fomites. These environmental transmission pathways require contact network formulations more realistically detailed than those based on social encounters or physical proximity. As a step toward improved assessment of environmental interventions, description of contact networks, and better use of environmental specimens to analyze transmission, an environmental infection transmission system model that describes the dynamics of human interaction with pathogens in the environment is presented. Its environmental parameters include the pathogen elimination rate, mu, and the rate humans pick up pathogens, rho, and deposit them, alpha. The ratio, rhoN/mu (N equals population size), indicates whether transmission is density dependent (low ratio), frequency dependent (high ratio), or in between. Transmission through frequently touched fomites, such as doorknobs, generates frequency-dependent patterns, while transmission through thoroughly mixed air or infrequently touched fomites generates density-dependent patterns. The environmental contamination ratio, alpha/gamma, reflects total agent deposition per infection and outbreak probability, where gamma is defined as the recovery rate. These insights provide theoretical contexts to examine the role of the environment in pathogen transmission and a framework to interpret environmental data to inform environmental interventions.

N2  - Background. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) is often used to evaluate complications in patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), but no study has correlated CT findings with the risk of developing a complicated CDI. Furthermore, the value of CT has not been evaluated since the emergence of the BI/NAP1/027 hypervirulent strain of C. difficile. We sought to describe and correlate abdominal CT findings with complicated CDI and to compare them before and after the emergence of the epidemic strain. Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all hospitalized patients 18 years or older who, from 1 January 1998 through 31 December 2006, underwent abdominal CT within 72 h of their first positive stool sample. Results. Of 1189 patients with newly diagnosed CDI, 165 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Patients who underwent CT were younger, had higher peak white blood cell counts and serum creatinine levels, and were more likely to experience fever than those who did not undergo CT. No difference in CT findings was noted before and after the emergence of BI/NAP1/027 CDI. Pleural effusion (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-6.6), colonic wall thickness > 15 mm (AOR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.1-33.9), peak white blood cell count >= 30 X 109 cells/L (AOR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.4-16.4), albumin level <20 g/L (AOR, 6.9; 95% CI, 2.4-20.1), and immunosuppression (AOR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.5-15.3) were independently associated with complicated CDI. Conclusions. In a selected sample of patients with CDI, CT provided prognostic information additional to what could be obtained from clinical and laboratory parameters. No change in CT characteristics was noted after the introduction of the BI/NAP1/027 strain in our center. © 2009 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

T1  - Senescence as an adaptation to limit the spread of disease
A1  - Mitteldorf J.
A1  - Pepper J. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Aging has the hallmarks of an evolved adaptation. It is controlled by genes that have been conserved over vast evolutionary distances, and most organisms are able to forestall aging in the most challenging of environments. But fundamental theoretical considerations imply that there can be no direct selection for aging. Senescence reduces individual fitness, and any group benefits are weak and widely dispersed over non-relatives. We offer a resolution to this paradox, suggesting a general mechanism by which senescence might have evolved as an adaptation. The proposed benefit is that senescence protects against infectious epidemics by controlling population density and increasing diversity of the host population. This mechanism is, in fact, already well-accepted in another context: it is the Red Queen Hypothesis for the evolution of sex. We illustrate the hypothesis using a spatially explicit agent-based model in which disease transmission is sensitive to population density as well as homogeneity. We find that individual senescence provides crucial population-level advantages, helping to control both these risk factors. Strong population-level advantages to individual senescence can overcome the within-population disadvantage of senescence. We conclude that frequent local extinctions provide a mechanism by which senescence may be selected as a population-level adaptation in its own right, without assuming pleiotropic benefits to the individual. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Estimating the risk of communicable diseases aboard cargo ships
A1  - Schlaich C.C.
A1  - Oldenburg M.
A1  - Lamshoft M.M. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Background. International travel and trade are known to be associated with the risk of spreading communicable diseases across borders. No international surveillance system for infectious diseases on ships exists. Outbreak reports and systematic studies mainly focus on disease activity on cruise ships. The study aims to assess the relevance of communicable disease occurrence on cargo ships. Methods. Retrospective analysis of all documented entries to 49 medical log books from seagoing cargo ships under German flag between 2000 and 2008. Incidence rates were calculated per 100 person-years at sea. Case series of acute respiratory illness, influenza-like illness, and infectious gastrointestinal illness affecting more than two persons within 1 successive week were classified as an outbreak. Attack rates were calculated based on number of entries to the medical log book in comparison to the average shipboard population during outbreak periods. Results. During more than 1.5 million person-days of observation, 21% of the visits to the ship's infirmary were due to presumably communicable diseases (45.8 consultations per 100 person-years). As many as 33.9 patients per 100 person-years sought medical attention for acute respiratory symptoms. Of the 68 outbreaks that met predefined criteria, 66 were caused by acute respiratory illness with a subset of 12 outbreaks caused by influenza-like illness. Attack rates ranged between 3 and 10 affected seafarers per ship (12.5&-41.6% of the crew). Two outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness were detected. Discussion. Respiratory illness is the most common cause of presumably communicable diseases aboard cargo ships and may cause outbreaks of considerable morbidity. Although the validity of the data is limited due to the use of nonprofessional diagnoses, missing or illegible entries, and restriction of the study population to German ships, the results provide guidance to ship owners and to Port Health Authorities to allocate resources and build capacities under International Health Regulations 2005. © 2009 International Society of Travel Medicine.

T1  - Tuberculosis elimination in the Canadian First Nations population: assessment by a state-transfer, compartmental epidemic model
A1  - Clark M.
A1  - Cameron D.W. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Background: Tuberculosis (TB) remains an important public health problem in Canadian Aboriginal (First Nations and Inuit) communities. The objectives of this study were to predict future disease burden and set feasible targets for the elimination of TB in the First Nations population, using retrospective data and an epidemic model. Method(s): Reported TB incidence data (1974-2002), previously published TB meningitis data from the pre-chemotherapy era, and previous estimates of disease risk following infection were used to estimate a trend in the annual risk of infection from 1929 to 2002, and the age-specific prevalence of infection in 2002. A state-transfer, compartmental model was then developed to predict future disease burden. Two scenarios were simulated, with different disease risk parameters. Result(s): The estimated prevalence of infection in 2002 was 20.9% in scenario 1 and 25.5% in scenario 2. Predicted incidence rates in 2015 were 16.8 per 100 000 and 11.7 per 100 000 for the two scenarios, respectively. The incidence of disease was not lower than 1 per 100 000 for either scenario in 2034, the arbitrarily chosen last year of the model. Conclusion(s): The goal of eliminating TB among Aboriginal peoples in Canada is a feasible one, but will only be achieved with continued investment in programs designed to control and prevent transmission. Reactivation disease cases may occur for a number of years to come, making rapid elimination a difficult goal. © 2008 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

The potential large-scale use of antiviral drugs brings with it the danger of drug resistance evolution. A number of recent studies have shown that the emergence of drug-resistant influenza could undermine the usefulness of antiviral drugs for the control of an epidemic or pandemic outbreak. While these studies have provided important insights, the inherently stochastic nature of resistance generation and spread, as well as the potential for ongoing evolution of the resistant strain have not been fully addressed. Here, we study a stochastic model of drug resistance emergence and consecutive evolution of the resistant strain in response to antiviral control during an influenza pandemic. We find that taking into consideration the ongoing evolution of the resistant strain does not increase the probability of resistance emergence; however, it increases the total number of infecteds if a resistant outbreak occurs. Our study further shows that taking stochasticity into account leads to results that can differ from deterministic models. Specifically, we find that rapid and strong control cannot only contain a drug sensitive outbreak, it can also prevent a resistant outbreak from occurring. We find that the best control strategy is early intervention heavily based on prophylaxis at a level that leads to outbreak containment. If containment is not possible, mitigation works best at intermediate levels of antiviral control. Finally, we show that the results are not very sensitive to the way resistance generation is modeled. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Introduction: Estimates of the prevalence of autism and pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) are discordant and are moving towards an apparent increase in rates. Literature review: The studies carried out since 1966 illustrate the variability of the protocols used and explanatory hypotheses put forward. These investigations are difficult, sparse, but still growing at the same time that a debate develops on the possible increase in actual prevalence. Indeed, the rate initially admitted for classic autism was 5/10,000, then 1/1000 with an expanded definition to the forms, but the current figures are very different (almost 0.7% for all PDD), and this increase raises questions. The arguments in favour of an apparent increase are primarily methodological. Several biases are encountered when one compares the recent publications with those of previous years. First, autism is better known and recognized than 30 or 40 years ago. Then, the diagnostic criteria used over time are changing variables, and comparisons difficult. Recent studies using the criteria of a broader definition of autism, polyhandicap with severe retardation and autism signs of lighter forms. The fact that children with autism are diagnosed more frequently in the younger age could also occasionally lead to an artificial increase in the number of cases identified in new surveys in populations of young children. Other factors are cited to explain the current increase. There could be higher rates of autism (and mental retardation) among children of migrants from distant countries, with the aetiological hypothesis of maternal infections, more frequent due to immune deficiency against infectious agents depending on the environment, metabolic decompensations also related to changes in surroundings, or more births from unions among migrant mothers and men with Asperger syndrome (with increased risk of paternity of a child with autism). Other theories relate to pollution, vaccinations, a growing number of premature babies; all assumptions that appear, for the time being, insufficiently explored and documented. The issue is also one of the motivations underlying these steps, and setting a parallel prevalence actually increased with this or that factor has presently been scientifically validated. Finally, if a careful reading of recent publications indicates that autism has become more frequent; assumptions that describe an increase in "artificial", based on methodological arguments, seem to be more consistent. Effects of extension of diagnostic criteria and nosography for PDD: Today, the recruitment of individuals with autism in a population far exceeds the initial criteria of Kanner in the 1970's. It includes clinical forms with associated pathologies, or lighter and probably more frequent clinical forms. Other assumptions arouse interest, but also controversy regarding their relevance. The enumeration of cases of PDD in a population is actually at its beginning. In the 1970's, "childhood psychoses" (the term then used) seemed rare. The identification of cases was probably the main reason. Long available figures remain scarce, and their rate increases gradually from the 1990s, but is, in fact, a problem of inflation. What is the part played in this flight of changing diagnostic criteria and substitutions, or other methodological effects? Or even opportunistic effects, if we speak of an epidemic to undermine a variety of factors. The evidence provided so far is the improved identification of cases, enlargement of the concept, and better shared diagnostic criteria. However, the validity and limitations of clinical forms are still vague and unresolved. Discussion(s): How to study epidemiology in the future - to move forward, studies should be designed with partners' medical history and medicosocial studies, based on a better consensual methodology, epidemiology, statistics and diagnosis, with a definition of the thresholds for inclusion, and arbitration procedures. On this basis, a study must also be coordinated with those concerning mental retardation, learning disorders, etc, otherwise the same topics will be counted twice or even three times. As for the addition of syndromic forms of PDD (those with known aetiology), their number is still below a proportion sufficient to be an appeal. Moreover, another problem exists: the degree of membership of each of these syndromes, or individual cases, or autistic spectrum disorders (internal variability phenotypes). For the moment, we could design two studies included better: developmental disorders and associated pathologies. Regarding the "ethic" dimension, a more regular diagnosis of PDD (preferred to that of mental retardation or learning disorder) will lead to shared practices and set limits for greater recognition. © 2008 L'Encephale, Paris.

N2  - Chronic kidney disease is associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes and should be screened for in all patients with cardiovascular disease or risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus using estimate of glomerular filtration rate and a random urine albumin-tocreatinine ratio. Strategies to identify and prevent chronic kidney di -sea se must be part of a comprehensive program of disease prevention, that include evaluation of tobacco use, diet and exercise patterns, body mass index, blood pressure, lipid profile, blood glucose and patient-appropriate cancer screening. The global increase in patients with chronic kidney disease is threatening to reach epidemic proportions over the next decade, and few countries will be able to meet the economic challenges posed. A change in global approach from treatment of renal failure to aggressive primary and secondary prevention is essential. We propose that the United Nations Millenium Developments Goals for 2000-2015 should be expanded to include combatting infectious diseases as well as chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, renal disease and cancer, using an integrated approach.

N2  - The appearance and spread of West Nile virus (WNv) in North America represent a recent example of how mosquito-borne diseases can develop in new settings. Understanding the epidemiological, biological, and geographical aspects of WNv is critical to developing a greater understanding of how newly emerging, migrating, or evolving vector-borne infectious disease can develop globally. To aid in the allocation of resources that mitigate future outbreaks and to better understand the geographic nature of WNv in the North American prairies, we employ spatial and nonspatial modeling methods to predict municipal-level risk of human WNv infection rates.We use data based on a combination of routinely collected electronic data sources. Our findings suggest general agreement between spatial and nonspatial approaches, and results are consistent with seroprevalence-based estimates.We suggest that spatial models based on administrative data can offer estimates of relative risk in human populations at less cost, and in a timelier manner than estimates based on serology specimens. © 2007 New York Academy of Sciences.

N2  - Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) is one of the main infectious diseases in Atlantic salmon farming with major economical implications. Despite the strong regulatory interventions, the ISA epidemic is not under control, worldwide. We study the data covering salmon farming in Norway from 2002 to 2005 and propose a stochastic space-time model for the transmission of the virus. We model seaway transmission between farm sites, transmission through shared management and infrastructure, biomass effects and other potential pathways within the farming industry. We find that biomass has an effect on infectiousness, the local contact network and seaway distance of 5 km represent similar risks, but a large component of risk originates from other sources, among which are possibly infected salmon smolt and boat traffic. © 2007 The Royal Society.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Although no naturally infected sheep with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has ever been discovered, it remains possible that BSE once infected the UK sheep population, has been transmitted between sheep, and is still present today. We constructed a mathematical model to assess the current maximum theoretical exposure to consumers from BSE-infected ovine material and to estimate the risk reduction that could be achieved by abattoir-based control options if BSE-infected sheep were ever found in the national flock. We predict that, if present, the exposure to consumers from a single BSE-infected sheep would be high: one sheep, close to the end of its incubation period, is likely to contribute 10-1000 times more infectious material than a fully infectious cow. Furthermore, 30% of this exposure comes from infectivity residing in lymphatic and peripheral tissue that cannot be completely removed from a carcass. We are 95% confident that throughout Great Britain, no more than four sheep flocks currently harbour an ongoing BSE epidemic. However, since the exposure from a single infected sheep is high, the annual human exposure from four 'typical' BSE-infected flocks could be considerable. Small reductions in exposure could be achieved by strategies based on tissue testing, a 12-month age restriction or expanded definitions of high-risk tissues. A six-month age restriction is likely to be more effective and genotype-based strategies the most effective. © 2007 The Royal Society.

N2  - Since 2001 models of the spread of foot-and-mouth disease, supported by the data from the UK epidemic, have been expounded as some of the best examples of problem-driven epidemic models. These claims are generally based on a comparison between model results and epidemic data at fairly coarse spatio-temporal resolution. Here, we focus on a comparison between model and data at the individual farm level, assessing the potential of the model to predict the infectious status of farms in both the short and long terms. Although the accuracy with which the model predicts farms reporting infection is between 5 and 15%, these low levels are attributable to the expected level of variation between epidemics, and are comparable to the agreement between two independent model simulations. By contrast, while the accuracy of predicting culls is higher (20-30%), this is lower than expected from the comparison between model epidemics. These results generally support the contention that the type of the model used in 2001 was a reliable representation of the epidemic process, but highlight the difficulties of predicting the complex human response, in terms of control strategies to the perceived epidemic risk. © 2008 The Royal Society.

N2  - Concerns regarding natural or induced emergence of infectious diseases have raised a debate on the pros and cons of pre-emptive vaccination of populations under uncertain risk. In the absence of immediate risk, ethical issues arise because even smaller risks associated with the vaccine are greater than the immediate disease risk (which is zero). The model proposed here seeks to formalize the vaccination decision process looking from the perspective of the susceptible individual, and results are shown in the context of the emergence of urban yellow fever in Brazil. The model decomposes the individual's choice about vaccinating or not into uncertain components. The choice is modelled as a function of (i) the risk of a vaccine adverse event, (ii) the risk of an outbreak and (iii) the probability of receiving the vaccine or escaping serious disease given an outbreak. Additionally, we explore how this decision varies as a function of mass vaccination strategies of varying efficiency. If disease is considered possible but unlikely (risk of outbreak less than 0.1), delay vaccination is a good strategy if a reasonably efficient campaign is expected. The advantage of waiting increases as the rate of transmission is reduced (low R0) suggesting that vector control programmes and emergency vaccination preparedness work together to favour this strategy. The opposing strategy, vaccinating pre-emptively, is favoured if the probability of yellow fever urbanization is high or if expected R0 is high and emergency action is expected to be slow. In summary, our model highlights the nonlinear dependence of an individual's best strategy on the preparedness of a response to a yellow fever outbreak or other emergent infectious disease. © 2007 The Royal Society.

T1  - The canine distemper epidemic in Serengeti: Are lions victims of a new highly virulent canine distemper virus strain, or is pathogen circulation stochasticity to blame?

N2  - In the year 1994, the Serengeti lion population was decimated by a canine distemper disease outbreak. Retrospective investigations showed that this host population had already been in contact with the pathogen in 1981 without any detected sign of disease. As an alternative to the virus mutation hypothesis to explain this difference in virulences observed in 1981 and 1994, we propose a novel mechanism of disease emergence based on variation in population immunity. We use a stochastic model to show that stochastic fluctuations in pathogen circulation, owing to a low probability of virus transmission from its reservoir to the target host and thereby resulting in variations in the global immunity level of the target host population, can explain the observations made in Serengeti. This mechanism may also be involved in other infectious disease emergences or re-emergences. © 2007 The Royal Society.

T1  - Experimentally induced change in infectious period affects transmission dynamics in a social group
A1  - Naug D.
A1  - Smith B. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - A key component of any epidemiological model is the infectious period, which greatly affects the dynamics and persistence of an infection. Social organization, leading to behavioural and spatial heterogeneities among potential susceptibles, interacts with infectious period to create different risk categories within a group. Using the honeybee (Apis mellifera) colony as a social model, a protocol that creates different infectious periods in individual bees and another that follows the diffusion of a transmittable tracer within a colony, we show experimentally how a short infectious period results in an epidemic process with low prevalence confined only to individuals at the outer edge of a group, while a long infectious period results in high prevalence distributed more universally among all the group members. We call this finding an evidence of 'organizational immunity' in a social network and propose that the honeybee colony provides a unique opportunity to test its role in social transmission processes. © 2006 The Royal Society.

T1  - Emerging zoonoses: The challenge for public health and biodefense
A1  - Murphy F.A. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - The concept of new and emerging diseases has captured the public interest and has revitalized the public health infectious disease research community. This interest has also resulted in competition for funding and turf wars between animal health and public health scientists and public officials and, in some cases, has delayed and hindered progress toward effective prevention, control and biodefense. There is a dynamic list of outbreaks causing substantial morbidity and mortality in humans and often in the reservoir animal species. Some agents have the potential to grow into major epidemics. There are many determinants that influence the emergence of diseases of concern that require the use of current understanding of the nature of agent persistence and spread. Additional factors that are global must be added to plans for prevention and control. To this complex mix has been added the potential for accidental or malicious release of agents. The nature of emerging infectious agents and their impact is largely unpredictable. Models that strive to predict the dynamics of agents may be useful but can also blind us to increasing disease risks if it does not match a specific model. Field investigations of early events will be critical and should drive prevention and control actions. Many disease agents have developed strategies to overcome extremes of reservoir qualities like population size and density. Every infectious agent spreads easier when its hosts are closer together. Zoonoses must be dealt with at the interface of human and animal health by all available information. Lessons learned from the emergence of and response to agents like West Nile virus, H5N1 avian influenza, SARS and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the cause of new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, must be used to create better plans for response and meet the challenge for public health and biodefense. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - A retrospective cohort study of 116 British pig farms was undertaken to investigate the epidemiological risk factors associated with herd breakdowns with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Farmers reported the PMWS status of their herd (case definition 1) and, where applicable, when the disease was first suspected and what they observed; they described a prolonged increase in mortality in six to T 6-week-old pigs that was not attributable to any disease known to be on their farm. There was over 90 per cent agreement on the farmers' PMWS status between the farmers and their veterinarians. Approximately 70 per cent of the breakdowns were confirmed at the laboratory (case definition 2) except during the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in 2001 when it was reduced to 30 per cent. Porcine circovirus type 2 antigen was detected in pigs examined postmortem (case definition 3) in approximately 90 per cent of the farms with increased mortality. The breakdowns occurred initially in the south of England and spread west and north, as well as locally in a radial pattern from the affected farms, and there was strong statistical evidence that there was non-random space-time clustering. The risk of herd breakdowns with PMWS was not constant; therefore, for each case definition, three survival models were developed with outcome variable time to breakdown of between January 2000 and January 2001, February 2001 to September 2001 (during FMD) or October 2001 to December 2003. Exposures with a bivariable significance of P<0-20 were tested in three multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. From January 2000 to January 2001 the risk of a herd breakdown with PMWS for definitions 1, 2 and 3 was greater for farms with 600 or more breeding sows, and for definitions 1 and 3 there was an increased risk associated with the purchase of replacement gilts rather than using homebred replacements. For definitions 1 and 3 the farms where the nearest pig farm had no breeding pigs were at greater risk of a breakdown than those where the nearest farm had breeding stock, as were the farms where visitors were not requested to avoid pigs for more than three days before visiting the farm during the FMD outbreak. From October 2001, the associated risks were identical for all three case definitions; farms were at greater risk when they had 600 or more breeding sows, if visitors had not avoided contact with pigs for more than three days before visiting the farm, and when there was a farm with PMWS less than five miles away. The affected farms were more likely to have disease associated with porcine parvovirus, porcine reproduction and respiratory syndrome virus, erysipelas, Escherichia coli and salmonella. These exposures were positively associated with large herds and the farm being close to other pig farms, but did not remain in the final models for breakdown with PMWS, indicating that such farms may be at greater risk of many infectious diseases.

T1  - Use of data mining techniques to investigate disease risk classification as a proxy for compromised biosecurity of cattle herds in Wales
A1  - Ortiz-Pelaez A.
A1  - Pfeiffer D.U. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Biosecurity is at the forefront of the fight against infectious diseases in animal populations. Few research studies have attempted to identify and quantify the effectiveness of biosecurity against disease introduction or presence in cattle farms and, when done, they have relied on the collection of on-farm data. Data on environmental, animal movement, demographic/husbandry systems and density disease determinants can be collated without requiring additional specific on-farm data collection activities, since they have already been collected for some other purposes. The aim of this study was to classify cattle herds according to their risk of disease presence as a proxy for compromised biosecurity in the cattle population of Wales in 2004 for risk-based surveillance purposes. RESULT(S): Three data mining methods have been applied: logistic regression, classification trees and factor analysis. Using the cattle holding population in Wales, a holding was considered positive if at least bovine TB or one of the ten most frequently diagnosed infectious or transmissible non-notifiable diseases in England and Wales, according to the Veterinary Investigation Surveillance Report (VIDA) had been diagnosed in 2004. High-risk holdings can be described as open large cattle herds located in high-density cattle areas with frequent movements off to many locations within Wales. Additional risks are associated with the holding being a dairy enterprise and with a large farming area. CONCLUSION(S): This work has demonstrated the potential of mining various livestock-relevant databases to obtain generic criteria for individual cattle herd biosecurity risk classification. Despite the data and analytical constraints the described risk profiles are highly specific and present variable sensitivity depending on the model specifications. Risk profiling of farms provides a tool for designing targeted surveillance activities for endemic or emerging diseases, regardless of the prior amount of information available on biosecurity at farm level. As the delivery of practical evidence-based information and advice is one of the priorities of Defra's new Animal Health and Welfare Strategy (AHWS), data-driven models, derived from existing databases, need to be developed that can then be used to inform activities during outbreaks of endemic diseases and to help design surveillance activities.

T1  - Evaluating the influence of epidemiological parameters and host ecology on the spread of phocine distemper virus through populations of harbour seals
A1  - Harris C.M.
A1  - Travis J.M.J.
A1  - Harwood J. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Background: Outbreaks of phocine distemper virus (PDV) in Europe during 1988 and 2002 were responsible for the death of around 23,000 and 30,000 harbour seals, respectively. These epidemics, particularly the one in 2002, provided an unusual opportunity to estimate epidemic parameters for a wildlife disease. There were marked regional differences in the values of some parameters both within and between epidemics. Methodology and Principal Findings: We used an individual-based model of seal movement that allowed us to incorporate realistic representations of space, time and animal behaviour into a traditional epidemiological modelling framework. We explored the potential influence of a range of ecological (foraging trip duration, time of epidemic onset, population size) and epidemiological (length of infectious period, contact rate between infectious and susceptible individuals, case mortality) parameters on four readily-measurable epidemic characteristics (number of dead individuals, duration of epidemic, peak mortality date and prevalence) and on the probability that an epidemic would occur in a particular region. We analysed the outputs as if they were the results of a series of virtual experiments, using Generalised Linear Modelling. All six variables had a significant effect on the probability that an epidemic would be recognised as an unusual mortality event by human observers. Conclusion(s): Regional and temporal variation in contact rate was the most likely cause of the observed differences between the two epidemics. This variation could be a consequence of differences in the way individuals divide their time between land and sea at different times of the year. © 2008 Harris et al.

N2  - Aim: To describe a secondary school outbreak of tuberculosis in Palmerston North, New Zealand in 2006. Method(s): Case and contact management was conducted by MidCentrai District Health Board according to national guidelines. Result(s): The index (and source) case was a school student. Delayed diagnosis led to extensive transmission. Contact investigation detected fifteen secondary cases, from six of whom Mycobacterium tuberculosis organism was cultured which was identical to that found in the index case. Latent tuberculosis infection was diagnosed in 235 of 1828 contacts. Following logistic regression, risk of infection was significantly associated with age, exposure setting (household and school vs other settings) and duration of exposure. Large numbers of contacts were infected who had no known contact with the index case, thus indicating probable tertiary transmission from the 7 infectious secondary cases. The secondary healthcare cost of the outbreak was estimated at $279,481. Findings from school tuberculosis (TB) outbreaks since 1990 are summarised. Conclusion(s): This was the largest tuberculosis outbreak described in New Zealand and one of the largest school outbreaks reported in the published literature. © NZMA.

N2  - The effect of proximity on infected premises was evaluated during the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemic that struck northern Italy in 1999-2000 by quantifying the spatial and temporal clustering of cases. The epidemic was caused by an H7N1 subtype of type A influenza virus that originated from a low-pathogenic AI virus that spread among poultry farms in northeastern Italy in 1999 and eventually became virulent by mutation. More than 90% of 413 infected premises were located in Lombardy and Veneto regions; of 382 outbreaks, 60% occurred in the Lombardy region and 40% in the Veneto region. Global and local spatial statistics were used to estimate the location and degree of clustering of cases with respect to the population at risk. Outbreaks were spatially clustered primarily in Lombardy, with a large cluster in Brescia province and another in Mantua province, on the border of Venero. Time series analysis was used to assess the temporal clustering of outbreaks. Temporal aggregation increased during the first 5 wk and decreased thereafter (probably as a result of eradication measures enforced in the Veneto region). Spatiotemporal clustering was assessed considering the Temporal Risk Window (TRW), the time period during which premises remain infectious and infection can spread to neighboring premises. The clustering pattern was similar to the one detected when considering spatial clustering (i.e., the larger clusters were identified in the Brescia and Mantua provinces of Lombardy). These resulrs highlight the role of proximity in the spread of AI virus and, when considering the TRW, indicate the possible direction of virus spread.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Buruli ulcer (BU) disease, caused by infection with the environmental mycobacterium M. ulcerans, is an emerging infectious disease in many tropical and sub-tropical countries. Although vectors and modes of transmission remain unknown, it is hypothesized that the transmission of BU disease is associated with human activities in or around aquatic environments, and that characteristics of the landscape (e.g., land use/cover) play a role in mediating BU disease. Several studies performed at relatively small spatial scales (e.g., within a single village or region of a country) support these hypotheses; however, if BU disease is associated with land use/cover characteristics, either through spatial constraints on vector-host dynamics or by mediating human activities, then large-scale (i.e., country-wide) associations should also emerge. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate associations between BU disease prevalence in villages in Benin, West Africa and surrounding land use/cover patterns and other map-based characteristics, and (2) identify areas with greater and lower than expected prevalence rates (i.e., disease clusters) to assist with the development of prevention and control programs. RESULT(S): Our landscape-based models identified low elevation, rural villages surrounded by forest land cover, and located in drainage basins with variable wetness patterns as being associated with higher BU disease prevalence rates. We also identified five spatial disease clusters. Three of the five clusters contained villages with greater than expected prevalence rates and two clusters contained villages with lower than expected prevalence rates. Those villages with greater than expected BU disease prevalence rates spanned a fairly narrow region of south-central Benin. CONCLUSION(S): Our analyses suggest that interactions between natural land cover and human alterations to the landscape likely play a role in the dynamics of BU disease. For example, urbanization, potentially by providing access to protected water sources, may reduce the likelihood of becoming infected with BU disease. Villages located at low elevations may have higher BU disease prevalence rates due to their close spatial proximity to high risk environments. In addition, forest land cover and drainage basins with variable wetness patterns may be important for providing suitable growth conditions for M. ulcerans, influencing the distribution and abundance of vectors, or mediating vector-human interactions. The identification of disease clusters in this study provides direction for future research aimed at better understanding these and other environmental and social determinants involved in BU disease outbreaks.

N2  - Neural tube defects (NTDs) have a complex and imperfectly understood etiology, in which both genetic and environmental factors might be involved. The aim of the study was to describe an excess of cases of NTDs in a small area in central Italy. Over a 2-wk period in autumn 2002, three diagnoses of anencephaly were made in a 2773-km2 area. As a consequence of these events, information on known risk factors as well as data on environmental changes, or epidemics of infectious diseases, in 2002-2004, were collected. The NTD rate was estimated for 10,000 births (live and stillborn) in this area. The 95% confidence intervals of rates were estimated assuming Poisson distribution of cases. Six cases of NTD were observed, with an NTD prevalence rate of 18.5 per 10,000 births (95% CI 17.0, 20.12). No evidence of known risk factors was reported. During summer 2002, the local service for environmental surveillance observed that the threshold level of drinking-water bacterial contamination had been exceeded, which probably resulted in an adjustment in the amount of chlorine added. The major difficulty in making hypotheses regarding the causes of birth defects is linking environmental risk factors exposure to fetal outcome. The prompt gathering of data may be essential. Thus, we emphasize the need for the activation of a population-based congenital malformation registry in order to achieve a deeper understanding of these events etiology.

T1  - Inactivation of influenza virus by solar radiation

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Influenza virus is readily transmitted by aerosols and its inactivation in the environment could play a role in limiting the spread of influenza epidemics. Ultraviolet radiation in sunlight is the primary virucidal agent in the environment but the time that influenza virus remains infectious outside its infected host remains to be established. In this study, we calculated the expected inactivation of influenza A virus by solar ultraviolet radiation in several cities of the world during different times of the year. The inactivation rates reported here indicate that influenza A virions should remain infectious after release from the host for several days during the winter "flu season" in many temperate-zone cities, with continued risk for reaerosolization and human infection. The correlation between low and high solar virucidal radiation and high and low disease prevalence, respectively, suggest that inactivation of viruses in the environment by solar UV radiation plays a role in the seasonal occurrence of influenza pandemics. © 2007 The Authors.

T1  - AIDS prevention in Germany
T3  - AIDS-Pravention in Deutschland
A1  - Pott E. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - In 1987 the national AIDS prevention campaign "Gib AIDS keine Chance" (Don't give AIDS a chance) was started in Germany. After a very difficult and controversial political debate about a probably successful response to AIDS, in the end a political decision was made in favour of the implementation of a long term "social learning strategy". Thus, since then the Bundeszentrale fur gesundheitliche Aufklarung (Federal Centre for Health Education, BZgA) has been running the campaign on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Health. The result of this prevention program is a low rate of infections. In Germany there were 2600 newly diagnosed infections in 2005: 59 % in homosexual men, 16 % by heterosexual contacts, 17 % in people from high prevalence countries and 7 % in i.v. drug users. In comparison to the international situation Germany has a relatively low HIV-prevalence even nowadays. However, Germany has also been confronted with an increasing number of newly diagnosed infections in the last few years. When the prevention program was started it was very important to build new structures for a successful implementation of the campaign. That meant for instance to build up an effective infrastructure for cooperation between the governmental and the nongovernmental sector, including organising the coordinated action among the partners at the federal, regional and local levels. Likewise, international networking was of great importance. A key element, relevant for the success of the campaign was the close cooperation at the federal level between the BZgA and the Deutsche AIDS Hilfe (German AIDS Help, DAH), to combine the highreach intervention in low-prevalence populations with intensive interventions for high prevalence groups. An effective national AIDS prevention campaign must reach the whole population; inform the public about the main risks of infection, about methods of protection and about what is not infectious. Moreover groups with a higher level of risk of infection must be addressed and motivated to adopt protective behaviour more intensely. The campaign thus must comprise closely related and mutually reinforcing elements: mass communication and individual communication measures, aimed at the public at large and at individual subgroups, national and international cooperation, especially the cooperation and task sharing with the DAH aimed at prevention in the epidemiologically most significant target groups, evaluation and quality assurance. The key element in this respect is the BZgA's annual representative survey of information levels, attitudes, motivation and behaviour in the more than 16- year-old population. In addition to the model of the special partnership between the BZgA and the DAH, a range of public-public partnerships, due to the German federalistic system, and public-private partnerships, which support public efforts, are necessary. It is shown that an increasing number of private partners are necessary to reinforce the program in a situation where Germany has to face new challenges. The new challenges are for instance high mobility in a globalizing society. In a world wide spreading epidemic no country will be excluded from the international development; the increase of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs); a tendency to decreasing protective behaviour caused by the optimism that a definitive cure may soon be available. The conception of evaluation of the campaign comprises an annual monitoring of knowledge, attitude and behaviour in the whole population and in specific target groups. It includes pretests of specific prevention instruments and evaluation of different activities. An indicator system is developed to measure the results of the campaign. By continuous feedback of the evaluation results into the further development of the campaign the steering of the campaign at a high level of quality is ensured. © Springer Medizin Verlag 2007.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - The theory of insect population dynamics has shown that heterogeneity in natural-enemy attack rates is strongly stabilizing. We tested the usefulness of this theory for outbreaking insects, many of which are attacked by infectious pathogens. We measured heterogeneity among gypsy moth larvae in their risk of infection with a nucleopolyhedrovirus, which is effectively heterogeneity in the pathogen's attack rate. Our data show that heterogeneity in infection risk in this insect is so high that it leads to a stable equilibrium in the models, which is inconsistent with the outbreaks seen in North American gypsy moth populations. Our data further suggest that infection risk declines after epidemics, in turn suggesting that the model assumption of constant infection risk is incorrect. We therefore constructed an alternative model in which natural selection drives fluctuations in infection risk, leading to reductions after epidemics because of selection for resistance and increases after epidemics because of a cost of resistance. This model shows cycles even for high heterogeneity, and experiments confirm that infection risk is indeed heritable. The model is very general, and so we argue that natural selection for disease resistance may play a role in many insect outbreaks. © 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

N2  - We estimated between-farm transmission parameters of the highly pathogenic avian-influenza (HPAI) epidemic that struck the poultry industry of northern Italy (including turkeys, layer hens, broilers, gamebirds, and waterfowl) from December 1999 through April 2000. We estimated the average number of susceptible farms that were infected with HPAI virus by each infectious farm during a day (beta) with a generalised linear model (GLM). The HPAI's reproductive ratios (Rh; the average number of new infected farms (IFs) that were caused by an infectious farm) were calculated separately for the regions of Lombardy and Veneto, where 382 out of 413 (92.5%) of IFs were located. In both regions, Rh decreased to ~1 during the second month of the epidemic (showing that its containment had been initiated). Subsequently, during the last two months of the epidemic, beta and Rh were reduced to 0.04/day and 0.6, respectively, in Veneto and to 0.07/day and 0.8 in Lombardy. The reduction of the susceptible population through strict control measures, including pre-emptive slaughter of at-risk poultry flocks, was implemented to a greatest extent in Veneto and this might have been associated with a more rapid control of the epidemic in this region than in Lombardy. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Viruses in drinking water can cause infectious diseases. In the past, hepatitis A and E were the most frequently observed drinking- water-borne viral infections, but in recent years several small- and large-scale norovirus epidemics have been described, even in Europe. All virus species spread via drinking water are of fecal origin. They are regularly identified in waste water even after conventional multi-stage water treatment. The approved disinfection methods can cope with these viruses if they are not integrated in larger particles. For this reason particle separation is particularly important in water treatment. Virological tests are not reliable enough to ensure that drinking water is sufficiently virus-free. The examination of 100 mL of water for E. coli and coliform bacteria is not adequate proof either. If potentially contaminated raw water is used, consumer safety must be ensured by calculating the performance of water treatment plants on a case-by-case basis. Such a calculation takes into account the virus load of the raw water, the efficiency of the physical and chemical particle elimination steps and the effect of disinfection. Those factors which determine the effectiveness of disinfection, namely concentration and exposure time or UV radiation strength, must be adjusted according to the risk of viral infection, and calculated settings must be adhered to, even if favorable E. coli levels may make them seem excessive. © 2007 Springer Medizin Verlag.

N2  - Several studies show that cross-transmission of germs among patients under dialysis can occur as a consequence of processes in which the dialysis machine participates. The need of vascular access and lengthy periods of extracorporeal circulation increases the vulnerability to infection from nearby microorganisms. This study is intended to analyze the structural and dynamic features of the cross-transmission network generated by the propagation of germs which are capable of contaminating the hemodialyzers. METHOD(S): The simulation was carried out in a Dialysis Unit equipped with 19 machines for 62 patients. One of these patients was randomly chosen and considered as a carrier of an infectious agent capable of being transmitted to other patients, by means of the shared use of the same dialysis machine. For 10 days, the patient-machine allocation couples were registered. Co-occurrence matrices were elaborated and processed with the program UCINET 6.1 for social network analysis. Graphs were designed to visualize the networks of contagion, the centrality measures were calculated and the dynamic performance of the network generated by the chaining of the successive exposures of machines and patients was studied. RESULT(S): The simulation let us visualize a rapid expansion of the risk of contagion of patients and contamination of machines. In 10 days, 87,09% of patients could have been exposed to the infection, and 68,42% of the machines could have been contaminated. These figures supposes that 5,4 new patients and 1,3 new machines could be potentially exposed every day. Along the first 5 days, the daily rate of exposure for patients and machines remains relatively low (3 new exposed patients and 1,2 new exposed machines every day). But the speed with witch the risk of contagion spreads, increases drastically in the last 5 days (7,8 new exposed patients every day). The fact that each patient requires at least 3 weekly sessions of dialysis and that a different machine can be allocated to him in each session explains that the risk of exposure can spread in some few days to a lot of patients and machines. It can also explain the difficulties found by the researches in identifying the responsible source of the origin of the sero-conversion outbreaks studied by the moment. CONCLUSION(S): If a germ can be transmitted from patient to patient by means of the incidental contamination of a dialysis machine, the appearance of an infected patient in a dialysis unit generates a risk of exposition that spreads quickly among other patients. Few days after an infected patient gets a dialysis session, it cannot be ruled out that most of the patients have been exposed to contagion and most of the machines exposed to contamination.

T1  - From bench to cageside: Risk assessment for rodent pathogen contamination of cells and biologics
A1  - Peterson N.C. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Many newly developed animal models involve the transfer of cells, serum, or other tissue-derived products into live rodents. These biologics can serve as repositories for adventitious rodent pathogens that, when used in animal studies, can alter research outcomes and result in endemic outbreaks. This review includes a description of some of the biologics that have inadvertently introduced infectious agents into in vivo studies and/or resulted in endemic outbreaks. I also discuss the points of potential exposure of specific biologics to adventitious rodent pathogens as well as the importance of acquiring a complete developmental and testing history of each biologic introduced into a barrier facility. There are descriptions of specific cases of mycoplasma and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDHV), two of the most common organisms that contaminate cells and cell byproducts. The information in this article should help investigators and animal resource program personnel to perform an appropriate risk assessment of biologics before their use in in vivo studies that involve rodents.

N2  - Distinguishing the manner in which dispersal limitation and niche requirements control the spread of invasive pathogens is important for prediction and early detection of disease outbreaks. Here, we use niche modeling augmented by dispersal estimation to examine the degree to which local habitat conditions vs. force of infection predict invasion of Phytophthora ramorum, the causal agent of the emerging infectious tree disease sudden oak death. We sampled 890 field plots for the presence of P. ramorum over a three-year period (2003-2005) across a range of host and abiotic conditions with variable proximities to known infections in California, USA. We developed and validated generalized linear models of invasion probability to analyze the relative predictive power of 12 niche variables and a negative exponential dispersal kernel estimated by likelihood profiling. Models were developed incrementally each year (2003, 2003-2004, 2003-2005) to examine annual variability in model parameters and to create realistic scenarios for using models to predict future infections and to guide early-detection sampling. Overall, 78 new infections were observed up to 33.5 km from the nearest known site of infection, with slightly increasing rates of prevalence across time windows (2003, 6.5%; 2003-2004, 7.1%; 2003-2005, 9.6%). The pathogen was not detected in many field plots that contained susceptible host vegetation. The generalized linear modeling indicated that the probability of invasion is limited by both dispersal and niche constraints. Probability of invasion was positively related to precipitation and temperature in the wet season and the presence of the inoculum-producing foliar host Umbellularia californica and decreased exponentially with distance to inoculum sources. Models that incorporated niche and dispersal parameters best predicted the locations of new infections, with accuracies ranging from 0.86 to 0.90, suggesting that the modeling approach can be used to forecast locations of disease spread. Application of the combined niche plus dispersal models in a geographic information system predicted the presence of P. ramorum across approximately 8228 km2 of California's 84785 km2 (9.7%) of land area with susceptible host species. This research illustrates how probabilistic modeling can be used to analyze the relative roles of niche and dispersal limitation in controlling the distribution of invasive pathogens.

T1  - Abortion in sheep. 1. Investigation and principal causes
A1  - Mearns R. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Abortion in sheep flocks is estimated to have a national annual incidence of 2 to 3 per cent, although some flocks may experience abortion storms involving large numbers of ewes. This article, the first of two on ovine abortion, discusses the priorities in the event of an outbreak, and reviews the diagnosis, and available options for control and prevention, of the most common infectious causes of abortion in the UK: namely, Chlamydophila abortus (the agent of enzootic abortion of ewes), Toxoplasma gondii and Campylobacter species. Together, these make up over 70 per cent of diagnoses based on submissions of abortion material at veterinary disease surveillance centres throughout England, Scotland and Wales. Part 2, to be published in the next issue, will discuss other common infectious causes, as well as some exotic diseases that pose an abortion risk to UK flocks.

T1  - Influenza as a health problem of sea travellers
A1  - Nitsch-Osuch A. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Traveling people may play an important role in spreading of influenza viruses in the word. The risk for exposure to influenza during travel depends on the time of year and destination, and the way of traveling (individual trip or organized excursion with a large group of people, especially coming from many different countries). Results of recent studies indicated that influenza may be the most frequent vaccine-preventable infectious disease with symptoms from respiratory tract. It is estimated that the attack rate of influenza in intercontinental travelers is 1%. The aim of the article is to describe current recommendations for travelers, especially see travelers (passengers and crew), concerning influenza prophylaxis, treatment and possible outbreak control. Guidelines for the prevention and control of influenza-like illness among passengers and crew members on cruise ships have also been described.

T1  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia as a quality indicator for patient safety?

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - The economic and clinical burden of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is uncontested. In many hospitals, VAP surveillance is conducted to identify outbreaks and to monitor infection rates. Here, we discuss the concept of benchmarking in health care as modeled on industry, and we contribute personal arguments against considering the VAP rate as a potential candidate for benchmarking or for monitoring the quality of patient care. Accurate benchmarking of VAP rates currently seems to be unfeasible, because the patient case mix is often too diverse and complicated to be adjusted for, and diagnostic criteria and surveillance protocols vary. Thus, the risk of drawing inaccurate comparisons is high. In contrast, some risk factors for VAP are modifiable and can be monitored and used as quality indicators. Process-oriented surveillance permits bypass of case-mix and diagnostic constraints. A well-defined interhospital surveillance system is necessary to prove that interventions on procedures do really lead to a reduction of VAP rates. © 2008 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

N2  - Background. Previous studies of risk factors for Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) have been limited by small sample sizes and case-control study designs. Many of these studies were performed during outbreaks of CDAD. Colonization pressure and use of fluoroquinolones, vancomycin, and gastric acid suppressors have not been fully evaluated as risk factors for CDAD. The purpose of this study was to determine risk factors for endemic CDAD, including CDAD pressure, a modified version of colonization pressure. Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 36,086 patients admitted to Barnes-Jewish Hospital (St. Louis, MO) during the period from 1 January 2003 through 31 December 2003. Administrative, laboratory, and pharmacy data were collected from electronic hospital databases. Colonization pressure was measured through a surrogate variable (i.e., CDAD pressure). Multivariable pooled logistic regression models were used to evaluate independent risk factors for CDAD. Results. The analysis included 382 CDAD case patient admissions and 35,704 non-case patient admissions. Significant independent risk factors for CDAD included increasing age, admission(s) in the previous 60 days, hypoalbuminemia, leukemia and/or lymphoma, mechanical ventilation, and receipt of antimotility drugs, histamine-2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors, intravenous vancomycin, fluoroquinolones, and first-, third-, or fourthgeneration cephalosporins. Increasing CDAD pressure was a strong risk factor for CDAD (for a CDAD pressure 11.4, the odds ratio was 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 2.9-5.6). Receipt of metronidazole was protective against CDAD (odds ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.6). Conclusions. This study identified the previously underrecognized CDAD risk factors of CDAD pressure and vancomycin. More studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between CDAD, these risk factors, and use of gastric acid suppressors and fluoroquinolones. © 2007 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

N2  - Chimpanzees have been used extensively as a model system for laboratory research on infectious diseases. Ironically, we know next to nothing about disease dynamics in wild chimpanzee populations. Here, we analyze long-term demographic and behavioral data from two habituated chimpanzee communities in Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire, where previous work has shown respiratory pathogens to be an important source of infant mortality. In this paper we trace the effect of social connectivity on infant mortality dynamics. We focus on social play which, as the primary context of contact between young chimpanzees, may serve as a key venue for pathogen transmission. Infant abundance and mortality rates at Tai cycled regularly and in a way that was not well explained in terms of environmental forcing. Rather, infant mortality cycles appeared to self-organize in response to the ontogeny of social play. Each cycle started when the death of multiple infants in an outbreak synchronized the reproductive cycles of their mothers. A pulse of births predictably arrived about twelve months later, with social connectivity increasing over the following two years as the large birth cohort approached the peak of social play. The high social connectivity at this play peak then appeared to facilitate further outbreaks. Our results provide the first evidence that social play has a strong role in determining chimpanzee disease transmission risk and the first record of chimpanzee disease cycles similar to those seen in human children. They also lend more support to the view that infectious diseases are a major threat to the survival of remaining chimpanzee populations. © 2008 Kuehl et al.

N2  - Antimicrobial therapy plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), presumably through disruption of indigenous intestinal microflora, thereby allowing C. difficile to grow and produce toxin. Investigations involving animal models and studies performed in vitro suggest that inhibitory activity against C. difficile and differences in the propensity to stimulate toxin production may also influence the likelihood that particular drugs may cause CDI. Although nearly all antimicrobial classes have been associated with CDI, clindamycin, third-generation cephalosporins, and penicillins have traditionally been considered to harbor the greatest risk. Recent studies have also implicated fluoroquinolones as high-risk agents, a finding that is most likely to be related in part to increasing fluoroquinolone resistance among epidemic strains (i.e., restriction-endonuclease analysis group BI/North American PFGE type 1 strains) and some nonepidemic strains of C. difficile. Restrictions in the use of clindamycin and third-generation cephalosporins have been associated with reductions in CDI. Because use of any antimicrobial has the potential to induce the onset of CDI and disease caused by other health care-associated pathogens, antimicrobial stewardship programs that promote judicious use of antimicrobials are encouraged in concert with environmental and infection control-related efforts. © 2007 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

N2  - Background. Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major cause of mortality in developing countries, and in these countries diabetes prevalence is increasing rapidly. Diabetes increases the risk of TB. Our aim was to assess the potential impact of diabetes as a risk factor for incident pulmonary tuberculosis, using India as an example. Methods. We constructed an epidemiological model using data on tuberculosis incidence, diabetes prevalence, population structure, and relative risk of tuberculosis associated with diabetes. We evaluated the contribution made by diabetes to both tuberculosis incidence, and to the difference between tuberculosis incidence in urban and rural areas. Results. In India in 2000 there were an estimated 20.7 million adults with diabetes, and 900,000 incident adult cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. Our calculations suggest that diabetes accounts for 14.8% (uncertainty range 7.1% to 23.8%) of pulmonary tuberculosis and 20.2% (8.3% to 41.9%) of smear-positive (i.e. infectious) tuberculosis. We estimate that the increased diabetes prevalence in urban areas is associated with a 15.2% greater smear-positive tuberculosis incidence in urban than rural areas - over a fifth of the estimated total difference. Conclusion. Diabetes makes a substantial contribution to the burden of incident tuberculosis in India, and the association is particularly strong for the infectious form of tuberculosis. The current diabetes epidemic may lead to a resurgence of tuberculosis in endemic regions, especially in urban areas. This potentially carries a risk of global spread with serious implications for tuberculosis control and the achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. © 2007 Stevenson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Background. An outbreak of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) occurred among renal transplant recipients attending the outpatient department at the Leiden University Medical Centre (Leiden, The Netherlands) from 1 March 2005 through 1 February 2006. Clinical, epidemiological, and molecular data were analyzed to trace the outbreak's origin. Methods. Renal transplant recipients with a clinical suspected diagnosis of PCP were included in the study. The diagnosis had to be confirmed by direct microscopy or real-time polymerase chain reaction of the dihydropteroate synthase gene in a bronchoalveolar fluid specimen. To detect contacts between patients, a transmission map was constructed. A case-control analysis was performed to asses whether infection was associated with certain wardrooms. Genotyping of Pneumocystis isolates was performed by sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) number 1 and 2 gene regions. Results. Twenty-two confirmed PCP cases were identified; approximately 0-1 would have been expected over the same time period. No risk factor was predominantly present, and standard immunosuppressive regimens had not changed. Liver transplant recipients who used the same outpatient facilities had not acquired PCP. The transmission map findings were compatible with interhuman transmission on multiple occasions. The case-control study did not point to wardrooms as a common source. Genotyping by sequencing of the ITS1 and ITS2 gene regions revealed type Ne in 12 of 16 successfully typed samples. Genotype Ne was found in only 2 of 12 reference samples. Conclusions. The clinical data and genotyping results are compatible with either interhuman transmission or an environmental source of infection. More complex models may account for PCP clusters. © 2007 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA load and the probability of transmitting HIV to an HIV-uninfected partner. However, the potential reduction in secondary transmission associated with ART may be offset by the longer duration of infectiousness. Methods. To estimate the effects of ART on the secondary transmission of HIV among men who have sex with men, we used a previously published state-transition model of HIV disease to simulate the clinical and virologic course of HIV infection among 2 cohorts of men who have sex with men: (1) a cohort of individuals who were not receiving ART and (2) a cohort of individuals treated with US guideline-concordant ART. The model tracked the number of acts of unprotected insertive anal intercourse, transmission risk per act as determined by HIV RNA level, and the number of secondary cases generated in each cohort. Results. The estimated mean number of secondary transmissions from an HIV-infected individual after 10, 20, and 30 years of infection were 1.9, 2.5, and 2.5, respectively, in the untreated cohort, compared with 1.4, 1.8, and 2.3, respectively, in the treated cohort. The total number of transmissions for the treated cohort began to exceed the total number of transmissions for the untreated cohort 33 years after infection; over the entire course of infection, treatment with ART led to a 23% increase in secondary infections. All estimates of the impact of ART on secondary transmission were sensitive to changes in risk behaviors. Conclusions. These results suggest that ART must be accompanied by effective HIV-related risk reduction interventions. Programs that target prevention to decrease further HIV transmission are crucial to epidemic control. © 2007 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background. Most documented "superspreading events" of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in hospitals, but the underlying causes remain unclear. We systematically analyzed the risk factors for nosocomial outbreaks of SARS among hospital wards in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, China. Methods. A case-control study was conducted. Case wards were hospital wards in which superspreading events of SARS occurred, and control wards were wards in which patients with SARS were admitted, but no subsequent nosocomial outbreaks occurred. Information on environmental and administrative factors was obtained through visits to the wards and interviews with ward managers or nursing officers. Relevant information about host factors was abstracted from the medical records. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify the major risk factors for superspreading events. Results. Eighty-six wards in 21 hospitals in Guangzhou and 38 wards in 5 hospitals in Hong Kong were included in the study. Six risk factors were significant in the final multiple-logistic regression model: minimum distance between beds of <=1 m (odds ratio [OR], 6.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-28.75), availability of washing or changing facilities for staff (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02-0.97), whether resuscitation was ever performed in the ward (OR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.04-13.87), whether staff members worked while experiencing symptoms (OR, 10.55; 95% CI, 2.28-48.87), whether any host patients (index patient or the first patient with SARS admitted to a ward) required oxygen therapy (OR, 4.30; 95% CI, 1.00-18.43), and whether any host patients required bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation (OR, 11.82; 95% CI, 1.97-70.80). Conclusions. Our results revealed that factors that were associated with the ward environment and administration were important in nosocomial outbreaks of SARS. The lessons learned from this study remain very important and highly relevant to the daily operation of hospital wards if we are to prevent nosocomial outbreaks of other respiratory infections in the future. © 2007 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

T1  - Analysis of the risk of introduction and spread of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus through importation of raw pigmeat into New Zealand
A1  - Neumann E.J.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - AIMS: To determine the frequency with which porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus (PRRSv) would become established in a non-commercial pig herd in New Zealand due to illegal feeding of uncooked food waste containing virus-contaminated pigmeat. To determine the likelihood of a single incursion resulting in a multi-farm outbreak of the disease, and describe the spatio-temporal characteristics of such an outbreak. METHOD(S): A Monte Carlo simulation model was constructed to determine the expected annual frequency of PRRSv infection being initiated in a non-commercial pig herd as a result of inadvertent feeding of pigmeat imported from countries endemically infected with the disease. Once the likelihood of PRRSv becoming established in a single pig herd was determined, stochastic spatially explicit infectious disease modelling software was utilised to model the temporal and spatial characteristics of the resulting epidemic. RESULT(S): Assuming the proportion of imported pigmeat remained at current levels, consumption patterns of pigmeat in households in New Zealand remained steady, and limited compliance with recently reintroduced regulations to prevent feeding of uncooked food waste, at least 4.3 pig herds per year were predicted to become infected with PRRSv. Simulation modelling of PRRSv epidemics related to initial infection of a non-commercial farm produced an estimate that 36% of these incursions would spread from the initial herd, and that these outbreaks would involve 93 herds on average in the first year. By increasing the estimated persistence of PRRSv infection in small herds, an average of 205 herds became infected in the first year. CONCLUSION(S): Given a mean of 4.3 infected premises per year and a 36% probability of infection spreading beyond the initial infected herd, there was a 95% likelihood of a multi-farm PRRS outbreak occurring within 3 years. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Introduction of PRRSv through importation of virus-contaminated pigmeat presents a high risk for establishment of the disease in the pig industry in New Zealand.

T1  - Real time bayesian estimation of the epidemic potential of emerging infectious diseases
A1  - Bettencourt L.M.A.
A1  - Ribeiro R.M. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Background: Fast changes in human demographics worldwide, coupled with increased mobility, and modified land uses make the threat of emerging infectious diseases increasingly important. Currently there is worldwide alert for H5N1 avian influenza becoming as transmissible in humans as seasonal influenza, and potentially causing a pandemic of unprecedented proportions. Here we show how epidemiological surveillance data for emerging infectious diseases can be interpreted in real time to assess changes in transmissibility with quantified uncertainty, and to perform running time predictions of new cases and guide logistics allocations. Methodology/Principal Findings: We develop an extension of standard epidemiological models, appropriate for emerging infectious diseases, that describes the probabilistic progression of case numbers due to the concurrent effects of (incipient) human transmission and multiple introductions from a reservoir. The model is cast in terms of surveillance observables and immediately suggests a simple graphical estimation procedure for the effective reproductive number R (mean number of cases generated by an infectious individual) of standard epidemics. For emerging infectious diseases, which typically show large relative case number fluctuations over time, we develop a Bayesian scheme for real time estimation of the probability distribution of the effective reproduction number and show how to use such inferences to formulate significance tests on future epidemiological observations. Conclusions/Significance: Violations of these significance tests define statistical anomalies that may signal changes in the epidemiology of emerging diseases and should trigger further field investigation. We apply the methodology to case data from World Health Organization reports to place bounds on the current transmissibility of H5N1 influenza in humans and establish a statistical basis for monitoring its evolution in real time. © 2008 Bettencourt, Ribeiro.

T1  - Case fatality proportion

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - A precise definition of case fatality proportion for compartmental disease transmission models with disease induced mortality rate is given. This is applied in classical epidemic modeling frameworks to models with multiple infectious stages, with multi-groups, with spatial patches, and with age of infection. It is shown that the case fatality proportion is the sum over all stages of the product of the probability of dying from the disease at a given stage and the probability of surviving to that stage. The derived expressions for case fatality can be used to estimate the disease induced death rates from more readily available data. © 2007 Society for Mathematical Biology.

T1  - Risk of waterborne illness via drinking water in the United States
A1  - Reynolds K.A.
A1  - Mena K.D.
A1  - Gerba C.P. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Outbreaks of disease attributable to drinking water are not common in the U.S., but they do still occur and can lead to serious acute, chronic, or sometimes fatal health consequences, particularly in sensitive and immunocompromised populations. From 1971 to 2002, there were 764 documented waterborne outbreaks associated with drinking water, resulting in 575,457 cases of illness and 79 deaths (Blackburn et al. 2004; Calderon 2004); however, the true impact of disease is estimated to be much higher. If properly applied, current protocols in municipal water treatment are effective at eliminating pathogens from water. However, inadequate, interrupted, or intermittent treatment has repeatedly been associated with waterborne disease outbreaks. Contamination is not evenly distributed but rather affected by the number of pathogens in the source water, the age of the distribution system, the quality of the delivered water, and climatic events that can tax treatment plant operations. Private water supplies are not regulated by the USEPA and are generally not treated or monitored, although very few of the municipal systems involved in documented outbreaks exceeded the USEPA's total coliform standard in the preceding 12 mon (Craun et al. 2002). We provide here estimates of waterborne infection and illness risks in the U.S. based on the total number of water systems, source water type, and total populations exposed. Furthermore, we evaluated all possible illnesses associated with the microbial infection and not just gastroenteritis. Our results indicate that 10.7 M infections/yr and 5.4 M illnesses/yr occur in populations served by community groundwater systems; 2.2 M infections/yr and 1.1 M illnesses/yr occur in noncommunity groundwater systems; and 26.0 M infections/yr and 13.0 M illnesses/yr occur in municipal surface water systems. The total estimated number of waterborne illnesses/yr in the U.S. is therefore estimated to be 19.5 M/yr. Others have recently estimated waterborne illness rates of 12M cases/yr (Colford et al. 2006) and 16 M cases/yr (Messner et al. 2006), yet our estimate considers all health outcomes associated with exposure to pathogens in drinking water rather than only gastrointestinal illness. Drinking water outbreaks exemplify known breaches in municipal water treatment and distribution processes and the failure of regulatory requirements to ensure water that is free of human pathogens. Water purification technologies applied at the point-of-use (POU) can be effective for limiting the effects of source water contamination, treatment plant inadequacies, minor intrusions in the distribution system, or deliberate posttreatment acts (i.e., bioterrorism). Epidemiological studies are conflicting on the benefits of POU water treatment. One prospective intervention study found that consumers of reverse-osmosis (POU) filtered water had 20%-35% less gastrointestinal illnesses than those consuming regular tap water, with an excess of 14% of illness due to contaminants introduced in the distribution system (Payment 1991, 1997). Two other studies using randomized, blinded, controlled trials determined that the risks were equal among groups supplied with POU-treated water compared to untreated tap water (Hellard et al. 2001; Colford et al. 2003). For immunocompromised populations, POU water treatment devices are recommended by the CDC and USEPA as one treatment option for reducing risks of Cryptosporidium and other types of infectious agents transmitted by drinking water. Other populations, including those experiencing "normal" life stages such as pregnancy, or those very young or very old, might also benefit from the utilization of additional water treatment options beyond the current multibarrier approach of municipal water treatment.

T1  - The local threshold for geographical spread of infectious diseases between farms
A1  - Boender G.J.
A1  - Meester R.
A1  - Gies E.
A1  - De Jong M.C.M. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - We investigated the influence of the spatial pattern of farms on the geographical spread of infectious livestock diseases, such as classical swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease and avian influenza in a combined analytical-numerical approach. Our purpose of this paper is to develop a method to identify the areas in which an infection has the potential to spread in an outbreak. In our model, each infected farm can infect neighbouring farms and the probability of transmission is a function of the inter-farm distance (spatial kernel). Therefore, the density of farms in an area is a good indicator for the probability of a major outbreak. In the epidemiological nomenclature, such density corresponds to a local reproduction ratio and we studied the critical behaviour of both the local density and the local reproduction ratio. We found that a threshold can be defined above which major outbreaks can occur, and the threshold value depends on the spatial kernel. Our expression for the threshold value is derived based on scaling arguments and contains two parameters in the exponents of the equation. We estimated these parameters from numerical results for the spatial spread using one particular mathematical function for the form of the spatial kernel. Subsequently, we show that our expression for the threshold using these estimated parameters agrees very well with numerical results for a number of different other functional forms of the spatial kernel (thus suggesting that we are dealing with universal parameters). As an illustration of the practical relevance of the presented method, we calculated the threshold value for avian influenza in the Netherlands and use it to produce a risk map for this disease. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Clostridium difficile: an emerging epidemic in nursing homes
A1  - Crogan N.L.
A1  - Evans B.C. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Clostridium difficile is currently recognized as the most common cause of nosocomial infectious diarrhea in the nursing home setting. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirm that the incidence of C. difficile has doubled in recent years and accounts for approximately 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis each year. Overall mortality associated with C. difficile infectious diarrhea is estimated to be 17% but is even higher in the older adult population. Older adults are at higher risk for this infection because of age-related changes in fecal flora and host defenses, as well as the presence of multiple comorbidities. Nursing staff, nurse practitioners, and physicians must become knowledgeable in the treatment and management of C. difficile before it reaches epidemic proportions. Diligent infection control practices, health care worker education, family education, and identification of new prevention and control strategies are vital to limiting its spread.

N2  - Background: Institutional transmission of airborne infections such as tuberculosis (TB) is an important public health problem, especially in resource-limited settings where protective measures such as negative-pressure isolation rooms are difficult to implement. Natural ventilation may offer a low-cost alternative. Our objective was to investigate the rates, determinants, and effects of natural ventilation in health care settings. Methods and Findings: The study was carried out in eight hospitals in Lima, Peru; five were hospitals of "oldfashioned" design built pre-1950, and three of "modern" design, built 1970-1990. In these hospitals 70 naturally ventilated clinical rooms where infectious patients are likely to be encountered were studied. These included respiratory isolation rooms, TB wards, respiratory wards, general medical wards, outpatient consulting rooms, waiting rooms, and emergency departments. These rooms were compared with 12 mechanically ventilated negative-pressure respiratory isolation rooms built post-2000. Ventilation was measured using a carbon dioxide tracer gas technique in 368 experiments. Architectural and environmental variables were measured. For each experiment, infection risk was estimated for TB exposure using the Wells-Riley model of airborne infection. We found that opening windows and doors provided median ventilation of 28 air changes/hour (ACH), more than double that of mechanically ventilated negative-pressure rooms ventilated at the 12 ACH recommended for high-risk areas, and 18 times that with windows and doors closed (p < 0.001). Facilities built more than 50 years ago, characterised by large windows and high ceilings, had greater ventilation than modern naturally ventilated rooms (40 versus 17 ACH; p < 0.001). Even within the lowest quartile of wind speeds, natural ventilation exceeded mechanical (p < 0.001). The Wells-Riley airborne infection model predicted that in mechanically ventilated rooms 39% of susceptible individuals would become infected following 24 h of exposure to untreated TB patients of infectiousness characterised in a well-documented outbreak. This infection rate compared with 33% in modern and 11% in pre-1950 naturally ventilated facilities with windows and doors open. Conclusion(s): Opening windows and doors maximises natural ventilation so that the risk of airborne contagion is much lower than with costly, maintenance-requiring mechanical ventilation systems. Old-fashioned clinical areas with high ceilings and large windows provide greatest protection. Natural ventilation costs little and is maintenance free, and is particularly suited to limited-resource settings and tropical climates, where the burden of TB and institutional TB transmission is highest. In settings where respiratory isolation is difficult and climate permits, windows and doors should be opened to reduce the risk of airborne contagion. © 2007 Escombe et al.

T1  - Transmission parameters of the 2001 foot and mouth epidemic in Great Britain

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Despite intensive ongoing research, key aspects of the spatial-temporal evolution of the 2001 foot and mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in Great Britain (GB) remain unexplained. Here we develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for estimating epidemiological parameters of the 2001 outbreak for a range of simple transmission models. We make the simplifying assumption that infectious farms were completely observed in 2001, equivalent to assuming that farms that were proactively culled but not diagnosed with FMD were not infectious, even if some were infected. We estimate how transmission parameters varied through time, highlighting the impact of the control measures on the progression of the epidemic. We demonstrate statistically significant evidence for assortative contact patterns between animals of the same species. Predictive risk maps of the transmission potential in different geographic areas of GB are presented for the fitted models.

N2  - In Romania, anthropozoonoses, and in this nosological context, human viral neuro-infections with incidental transmission by active vectors with natural foci, may be considered infectious diseases with endemic emergence. Since 1996, the form of manifestation of the epidemiological process by viral meningitis and meningoencephalitis, the etiological structure of morbidity and the problem of natural foci have required the implementation of an effective epidemiological survey strategy. This paper includes the results of an epidemiological survey and the general population seroepidemiological evaluation of acute and historic infections, identified as arboviral TBE-CEE neuro-infections. MATERIAL AND METHOD: In the interval 1999-2006, the following aspects were studied: an endemic episode of 37 cases of TBE-CEE neuro-virus infection in a rural population. The epidemiological inquiry was conclusive for the transmission of infection by goat milk from highly tick infested animals, in a habitat with identified natural sylvatic and peridomestic foci; an endemic-epidemic state with 17 cases of TBE-CEE neuro-virus infection, occurring within a short time interval, in a rural community. Recent history revealed tick infestation from a common natural area; the size and dynamics of territorial changes in natural foci by comparing the prevalence of historic TBE-CEE infections in 41 subjects at known occupational risk, 95 subjects from the domestic habitat of former patients with TBE-CEE neuro-infection, and 172 subjects from areas adjacent to natural foci. RESULT(S): Specific serology was positive in 41.5%, 11.6%, and 5.8% of the investigated subjects (chi2 = 38.98); the prevalence of historic TBE-CEE infection in the general population was estimated at 0.6% (0.3-1.1%, CI = 95%) by the seroepidemiological investigation of a representative sample of the Transylvanian population (1669 subjects); the TBE-CEE etiology of acute viral meningitis/meningoencephalitis in the interval 2001-2006 (862 cases in the area) with a prevalence of 14.1% (10.9-17.8%, CI = 95%) of the cases, evaluated based on the etiological investigation of representative samples from 2 counties and on request from the territory (in total 397 investigated cases). Seroepidemiological tests validated by external quality control were performed using the ELISA technique, with standardized immune reagents (IgM and/or IgG specific). CONCLUSION(S): Based on the epidemiological survey performed, it may be concluded that the specific infection sources and the morbidity of human TBE-CEE virus neuro-infections have an endemic emergent course and natural foci are in full territorial expansion.

N2  - Ex situ conservation is of increasing importance to prevent the extinction of endangered animals in the wild. Despite low success rates of reintroduction programs few researchers have investigated empirically the efficacy of captive breeding regimes for the release of captive-bred vertebrates. We used guppies (Poecilia reticulata) from two populations in Trinidad to compare different conservation breeding regimes. The upper Aripo population was chosen for its small effective population size (Ne = 100) and genetic isolation, which makes it representative of many endangered natural populations. By contrast, the lower Aripo population is a genetically diverse, much larger population (Ne = 2400). We examined three captive-breeding regimes: (1) inbreeding fish crossed with their full siblings, (2) minimized inbreeding, no consanguineous matings, and (3) control fish crossed at random. We kept pedigree records for all regimes so that we could calculate inbreeding coefficients over four generations. The body size and fertility of guppies was significantly reduced due to inbreeding depression. The genetic load of sterile equivalents was particularly high for the lower Aripo population. Body size also declined due to breeding conditions in the captive environment. After four generations in captivity, the fish were released into a mesocosm in Trinidad. Captive-bred guppies were extremely susceptible to gyrodactylid parasites (58% survival rate) compared with their wild counterparts (96% survival). A reduced level of immunogenetic variation due to inbreeding and lack of exposure to natural parasites may have rendered captive-bred individuals more prone to infectious disease. The threat of disease outbreak is particularly high when naive captive-bred hosts are released in wild populations. Susceptible, captive-bred hosts could facilitate the transmission of parasites throughout the wild population, thus initiating an epidemic. This risk could potentially be reduced by prior exposure to parasites before release and gradual release of captive-bred individuals. © 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Aims: To estimate the incidence of infectious syphilis in the Wellington region between 2004 and 2006, and to characterise those with infectious syphilis, in terms of demographic and risk factors, in order to inform control of the disease. Method(s): Based on information from regional laboratories, a questionnaire was sent to the requesting clinician for all individuals with positive syphilis serology between January 2004 and December 2005. The questionnaire was also used for cases of infectious syphilis seen at regional sexual health clinics in 2006. All information was recorded anonymously. Result(s): 120 questionnaires were returned (67%), and 15 cases of infectious syphilis were identified (5 in 2004, 10 in 2005), including 3 cases not known to the sexual health clinics and hence not reported to the Institute of Environmental & Scientific Research (ESR). Another 15 cases of infectious syphilis were identified from sexual health clinic records in 2006 up to October. These 30 cases of infectious syphilis were predominantly men who have sex with men (MSM) (80%), and mainly born in New Zealand (83%). Few cases reported recent sex overseas, indicating local transmission, and anonymous partners were common. The annual incidence (per 100,000 population) of infectious syphilis is estimated at 1.3 in 2004, 2.6 in 2005, and 5.9 in 2006. Conclusion(s): Wellington is experiencing an outbreak of infectious syphilis, principally amongst MSM, but with crossover into the heterosexual community. Efforts are being made to control this outbreak through education of clinicians, partner notification, and offering screening and education in non-medical settings to at risk groups. We call on the Ministry of Health to enhance syphilis surveillance as a matter of urgency. © NZMA.

T1  - From bench to cageside: Risk assessment for rodent pathogen contamination of cells and biologics
A1  - Peterson N.C. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Many newly developed animal models involve the transfer of cells, serum, or other tissue-derived products into live rodents. These biologics can serve as repositories for adventitious rodent pathogens that, when used in animal studies, can alter research outcomes and result in endemic outbreaks. This review includes a description of some of the biologics that have inadvertently introduced infectious agents into in vivo studies and/or resulted in endemic outbreaks. I also discuss the points of potential exposure of specific biologics to adventitious rodent pathogens as well as the importance of acquiring a complete developmental and testing history of each biologic introduced into a barrier facility. There are descriptions of specific cases of mycoplasma and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDHV), two of the most common organisms that contaminate cells and cell byproducts. The information in this article should help investigators and animal resource program personnel to perform an appropriate risk assessment of biologics before their use in in vivo studies that involve rodents.

N2  - In July 2002, one of the largest outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease associated with a public bathhouse in Japan occurred in Miyazaki. The local government and the University of Miyazaki performed a retrospective investigation of those persons who were considered to have been exposed to Legionella. This investigation provided a unique opportunity to analyze the clinical presentation of patients with outbreak-associated Legionnaires' disease. The purpose of the present study was to analyze high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) scans for the characteristic findings of Legionnaires' disease and to evaluate the correlation between the radiological severity on the initial chest X-ray and the outcome of the patients. Radiological findings of HRCT were analyzed in 35 patients. The radiological severity on chest X-ray was evaluated in 69 patients, utilizing the pneumonia scoring system proposed by the Research Committee on Legionnaires' Disease of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of the Japanese Government. Air-space consolidation, ground-glass opacity, and pleural effusion were common features on HRCT in patients with Legionnaires' disease. Typical HRCT findings showed bilateral multilobar infiltrates in the subpleural areas without centrilobular opacities. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified male sex, short incubation period, high serum C-reactive protein, high serum alanine aminotransferase, hyponatremia, and positive Legionella urinary antigen test results as independent risk factors for high pneumonia scores. Patients with high pneumonia scores required significantly longer hospitalization and showed poor prognoses. © 2008 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases.

N2  - Few reports have analyzed the clinical manifestations of patients with Legionnaires' disease in large outbreaks throughout the world. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical presentation and prognostic factors in 76 patients with Legionnaires' disease, reported by local physicians, in a large outbreak resulting from contamination of the water in a public bathhouse in Miyazaki, Japan. Fever, gastrointestinal tract symptoms, and abnormal neurological findings were seen in 95%, 35%, and 21% of the 76 patients, respectively. Respiratory tract symptoms were seen in only 42% of the patients, although all of these patients revealed pneumonia on chest X-ray. Only 20 (31%) of the 64 patients who had microbiological tests were reported to have positive results for one of the three microbiological tests (sputum culture, serology, and urinary antigen) which are specific for Legionella infection. Based on univariate analysis, the existence of neurological symptoms, elevated levels of C-reactive protein and transaminases, hyponatremia, a positive urinary antigen test, and serological evidence of Legionella infection were independent risk factors for poor clinical courses in patients with Legionnaires' disease. Patients treated with antimicrobial agents, such as macrolides, tetracyclines, and/or fluoroquinolones, within 3 days of onset of illness exhibited significantly better outcomes, when assessed by a multivariate logistic-regression model, after adjusting for the severity of pneumonia. Taking a careful history and documenting potential Legionella exposure, as well as microbiological testing, is important for an accurate diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease. Antimicrobials effective against Legionella bacteria should be administered without delay in subjects with suspected Legionnaires' disease. © 2008 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases.

T1  - Seasonal influenza in the United States, France, and Australia: Transmission and prospects for control

N2  - Recurrent epidemics of influenza are observed seasonally around the world with considerable health and economic consequences. A key quantity for the control of infectious diseases is the reproduction number, which measures the transmissibility of a pathogen and determines the magnitude of public health interventions necessary to control epidemics. Here we applied a simple epidemic model to weekly indicators of influenza mortality to estimate the reproduction numbers of seasonal influenza epidemics spanning three decades in the United States, France, and Australia. We found similar distributions of reproduction number estimates in the three countries, with mean value 1.3 and important year-to-year variability (range 0.9-2.1). Estimates derived from two different mortality indicators (pneumonia and influenza excess deaths and influenza-specific deaths) were in close agreement for the United States (correlation=0.61, P <0.001) and France (correlation=0.79, P <0.001), but not Australia. Interestingly, high prevalence of A/H3N2 influenza viruses was associated with high transmission seasons (P = 0.006), while B viruses were more prevalent in low transmission seasons (P = 0.004). The current vaccination strategy targeted at people at highest risk of severe disease outcome is suboptimal because current vaccines are poorly immunogenic in these population groups. Our results suggest that interrupting transmission of seasonal influenza would require a relatively high vaccination coverage (>60%) in healthy individuals who respond well to vaccine, in addition to periodic re-vaccination due to evolving viral antigens and waning population immunity. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

N2  - The infectivity of pathogenic microorganisms is a key factor in the transmission of an infectious disease in a susceptible population. Microbial infectivity is generally estimated from dose-response studies in human volunteers. This can only be done with mildly pathogenic organisms. Here a hierarchical Beta-Poisson dose-response model is developed utilizing data from human outbreaks. On the lowest level each outbreak is modelled separately and these are then combined at a second level to produce a group dose-response relation. The distribution of foodborne pathogens often shows strong heterogeneity and this is incorporated by introducing an additional parameter to the dose-response model, accounting for the degree of overdispersion relative to Poisson distribution. It was found that heterogeneity considerably influences the shape of the dose-response relationship and increases uncertainty in predicted risk. This uncertainty is greater than previously reported surrogate and outbreak models using a single level of analysis. Monte Carlo parameter samples (alpha, beta of the Beta-Poisson model) can be readily incorporated in risk assessment models built using tools such as S-plus and @Risk. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the potential factors associated with infection sources and modes of transmission during a recent outbreak (October 2004) of tularemia in Suluova, Turkey. Method(s): Following the diagnosis of five patients with tularemia in October 2004, active surveillance was initiated to identify further cases. This was a matched case-control study with analysis based on the first 43 cases of tularemia (probable or suspected) and 43 matched controls. A probable case was defined as a patient, resident in Suluova, who had signs and symptoms (regional lymphadenopathy and fever) compatible with tularemia and a positive serology or PCR for Francisella tularensis during the period October 21 to November 31, 2004. A suspected case was defined as a patient with compatible signs and symptoms who did not meet the laboratory criteria for a probable case, who also had no laboratory evidence of infection by other microorganisms, and who was resident in Suluova between the same dates. The microagglutination test was used for serological diagnosis. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect information on general demographics, exposure to all known sources of tularemia infection, potential risk factors related to water and animals (i.e., fishing, farming, hunting, and other activities), and the environmental conditions of the house. PCR was used to screen for evidence of the tularemia agents in clinical samples from patients and water samples. Result(s): The overall attack rate was 2.3 per 1000 population (86/38 000). Twenty-eight suspected cases and 15 probable cases of tularemia were included in the study. The most common presenting symptom was lymphadenopathy present in 95.3%, followed by fever (83.7%) and sore throat (79.1%). Twenty-eight out of 43 were reported to have painful lymph nodes. F. tularensis was detected by PCR in samples obtained from the ulcerated lesions of two patients. In the multivariate logistic regression model, keeping a domestic animal in the garden was associated with an increased risk of contracting the disease (OR = 10.87; 95% CI: 1.26-93.65; p = 0.03). F. tularensis was detected by PCR in the water sample obtained from the rivulet that passes through Suluova. Conclusion(s): The results of this study show that case-control studies may be useful for analyzing epidemics and for identifying the source of infection. In order to prevent water-related zoonotic infections, water and sewerage systems should be improved. © 2007 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

T1  - Generation interval contraction and epidemic data analysis

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - The generation interval is the time between the infection time of an infected person and the infection time of his or her infector. Probability density functions for generation intervals have been an important input for epidemic models and epidemic data analysis. In this paper, we specify a general stochastic SIR epidemic model and prove that the mean generation interval decreases when susceptible persons are at risk of infectious contact from multiple sources. The intuition behind this is that when a susceptible person has multiple potential infectors, there is a "race" to infect him or her in which only the first infectious contact leads to infection. In an epidemic, the mean generation interval contracts as the prevalence of infection increases. We call this global competition among potential infectors. When there is rapid transmission within clusters of contacts, generation interval contraction can be caused by a high local prevalence of infection even when the global prevalence is low. We call this local competition among potential infectors. Using simulations, we illustrate both types of competition. Finally, we show that hazards of infectious contact can be used instead of generation intervals to estimate the time course of the effective reproductive number in an epidemic. This approach leads naturally to partial likelihoods for epidemic data that are very similar to those that arise in survival analysis, opening a promising avenue of methodological research in infectious disease epidemiology. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: To estimate if Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) is increasing in peripartum women. Study Design: Peripartum CDAD was assessed through 1) passive surveillance collecting clinical and pathology data on severe cases and 2) survey among infectious disease consultants (ICDs) in the Emerging Infections Network. Result(s): Ten severe cases were collected; most had associated antibiotic use. Seven women were either admitted to the ICU or underwent colectomy. Three infants were stillborn, and 3 women died. The epidemic Clostridium difficile strain was found in 2 cases. Among 798 ICDs, 419 (52%) participated in the survey. Thirty-seven respondents (9%) recalled 55 cases, mostly in the postpartum period with 21 complications, mainly due to relapse. Conclusion(s): Severe CDAD may be increasing in peripartum women. Clinicians should have a low threshold for testing, be aware of the potential for severe outcomes, and take steps to reduce both the risk of disease and resultant complications. © 2008 Mosby, Inc.

T1  - Deterministic epidemic models with explicit household structure
A1  - House T.
A1  - Keeling M.J. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - For a wide range of airborne infectious diseases, transmission within the family or household is a key mechanism for the spread and persistence of infection. In general, household-based transmission is relatively strong but only involves a limited number of individuals in contact with each infectious person. In contrast, transmission outside the household can be characterised by many contacts but a lower probability of transmission. Here we develop a relatively simple dynamical model that captures these two transmission regimes. We compare the dynamics of such models for a range of household sizes, whilst constraining all models to have equal early growth rate so that all models fit to the same early incidence observations of an epidemic. Finally we consider the use of prophylactic vaccination, responsive vaccination, or antivirals to combat epidemic spread and focus on whether it is optimal to target controls at entire households or to treat individuals independently. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Network epidemic models with two levels of mixing
A1  - Ball F.
A1  - Neal P. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - The study of epidemics on social networks has attracted considerable attention recently. In this paper, we consider a stochastic SIR (susceptible-> infective-> removed) model for the spread of an epidemic on a finite network, having an arbitrary but specified degree distribution, in which individuals also make casual contacts, i.e. with people chosen uniformly from the population. The behaviour of the model as the network size tends to infinity is investigated. In particular, the basic reproduction number R0, that governs whether or not an epidemic with few initial infectives can become established is determined, as are the probability that an epidemic becomes established and the proportion of the population who are ultimately infected by such an epidemic. For the case when the infectious period is constant and all individuals in the network have the same degree, the asymptotic variance and a central limit theorem for the size of an epidemic that becomes established are obtained. Letting the rate at which individuals make casual contacts decrease to zero yields, heuristically, corresponding results for the model without casual contacts, i.e. for the standard SIR network epidemic model. A deterministic model that approximates the spread of an epidemic that becomes established in a large population is also derived. The theory is illustrated by numerical studies, which demonstrate that the asymptotic approximations work well, even for only moderately sized networks, and that the degree distribution and the inclusion of casual contacts can each have a major impact on the outcome of an epidemic. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Interpreting declines in HIV prevalence: Impact of spatial aggregation and migration on expected declines in prevalence
A1  - Walker P.T.

A1  - White P.J.
A1  - Garnett G.P. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Background: Declines in the prevalence of HIV might occur due to natural epidemic dynamics rather than changes in risk behaviour. Determining the cause of an observed decline is important in understanding the epidemiology of HIV. Objective(s): To explore how patterns of recruitment and interactions between subpopulations in different areas influence the predicted decline in the prevalence of HIV in the absence of reductions in risk behaviour. Method(s): A deterministic mathematical model of the heterosexual transmission of HIV in high prevalence endemic settings incorporating various patterns of recruitment to high-risk behaviour groups, population growth and migration was solved numerically. The possibility that apparent trends are generated or obscured through aggregating data from across areas experiencing different epidemics is also considered. Result(s): Declines in the prevalence of HIV can occur even if individuals do not change behaviour, raising the possibility that epidemic downturns could be wrongly attributed to interventions. This effect is greatest when individuals do not enter higher risk groups to compensate for reductions in size caused by deaths from AIDS and when migration is non-random with respect to risk or infectious status and migration patterns change as the epidemic matures. In contrast, aggregating prevalence data from subregions with different epidemic profiles tends to mask declines in prevalence. Conclusion(s): Interpreting surveillance data is important in understanding widespread responses to HIV epidemics. The results show that understanding patterns of adoption of risk behaviours and patterns of migration is important in interpreting declines in the prevalence of HIV.

N2  - Malaria is one of the most important infectious diseases with regard to morbidity and mortality. One third of the global population is at risk of malaria in areas with endemic or epidemic occurrence. It has been estimated that the malaria burden is more than 500 million per year in more than 90 countries. Malaria mortality is 1 to 2 million in children under five years of age. Epidemiology and control of malaria are essentially different in endemic and non-endemic areas. If health personnel is aware about the possibility of malaria in a returned traveller with unclear fever, diagnosis is easy and the patient could be treated fast and efficiently. New developments, such as artemisinin-based drug combinations, long-lasting insecticide bed nets, intermittent preventive treatment and advances of vaccine design can contribute to reduce malaria in endemic areas. Important constraints for a successful control are lacking infrastructure and low budgets for the implementation of measures where they are most urgently needed. © 2008.

T1  - Control of emerging infectious diseases using responsive imperfect vaccination and isolation

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - This paper is concerned with a stochastic model for the spread of an SEIR (susceptible -> exposed (= latent) -> infective -> removed) epidemic among a population partitioned into households, featuring different rates of infection for within and between households. The model incorporates responsive vaccination and isolation policies, based upon the appearance of diagnosed cases in households. Different models for imperfect vaccine response are considered. A threshold parameter R*, which determines whether or not a major epidemic can occur, and the probability of a major epidemic are obtained for different infectious and latent period distributions. Simpler expressions for these quantities are obtained in the limiting case of infinite within-household infection rate. Numerical studies suggest that the choice of infectious period distribution and whether or not latent individuals are vaccine-sensitive have a material influence on the spread of the epidemic, while, for given vaccine efficacy, the choice of vaccine action model is less influential. They also suggest that an effective isolation policy has a more significant impact than vaccination. The results show that R* alone is not sufficient to summarise the potential for an epidemic. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - We consider a (social) network whose structure can be represented by a simple random graph having a pre-specified degree distribution. A Markovian susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) epidemic model is defined on such a social graph. We then consider two real-time vaccination models for contact tracing during the early stages of an epidemic outbreak. The first model considers vaccination of each friend of an infectious individual (once identified) independently with probability rho. The second model is related to the first model but also sets a bound on the maximum number an infectious individual can infect before being identified. Expressions are derived for the influence on the reproduction number of these vaccination models. We give some numerical examples and simulation results based on the Poisson and heavy-tail degree distributions where it is shown that the second vaccination model has a bigger advantage compared to the first model for the heavy-tail degree distribution. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Foot-and-mouth disease: A review of intranasal infection of cattle, sheep and pigs
A1  - Sellers R.
A1  - Gloster J. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - In an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) it is important to identify animals at risk from airborne virus. Investigations have been carried out over the years to determine the dose required to infect cattle, sheep and pigs by the intranasal route. This paper reviews the results of investigations for animals which have been infected by instillation or spraying a virus suspension into the nostrils or by exposure to affected animals through a mask or by indirect contact. The lowest doses were found by use of a mask. With virus from affected pigs given through a mask, doses of 18 infectious units (IU) in cattle and 8 IU in sheep were found to cause infection and give rise to lesions. Overall, cattle required the least amount of virus followed by sheep. Pigs required a dose of 22 IU to cause infection and a dose of 125 IU to give rise to lesions. In many experiments pigs failed to become infected. With all three species the dose varied with the individual animal and the virus strain. For modelling previous outbreaks and in real time, a dose of 8 IU or 10 and 50% infectious doses (ID50) could be used where cattle and sheep were involved. Experience in the field, combined with the results from experiments involving natural infection, indicate that pigs are not readily infected by the intranasal route. However, for modelling purposes a dose of about 25 IU should be used with care. Investigations are needed to determine doses for virus strains currently in circulation around the world. In addition, the nature of the aerosol droplets needs to be analysed to determine how the respective amounts of infective and non-infective virus particles, host components and, in later emissions, the presence of antibody affect the survival in air and ability to infect the respiratory tract. Further work is also required to correlate laboratory and field findings through incorporation of the doses into modelling the virus concentration downwind in order that those responsible for controlling FMD are provided with the best available assessment of airborne spread. Finally, the doses found for infection by the intranasal route could be applied to other methods of spread where virus is inhaled to assess risk. Crown Copyright © 2007.

T1  - Finding optimal vaccination strategies under parameter uncertainty using stochastic programming

A1  - Sattenspiel L.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - We present a stochastic programming framework for finding the optimal vaccination policy for controlling infectious disease epidemics under parameter uncertainty. Stochastic programming is a popular framework for including the effects of parameter uncertainty in a mathematical optimization model. The problem is initially formulated to find the minimum cost vaccination policy under a chance-constraint. The chance-constraint requires that the probability that R* <= 1 be greater than some parameter alpha, where R* is the post-vaccination reproduction number. We also show how to formulate the problem in two additional cases: (a) finding the optimal vaccination policy when vaccine supply is limited and (b) a cost-benefit scenario. The class of epidemic models for which this method can be used is described and we present an example formulation for which the resulting problem is a mixed-integer program. A short numerical example based on plausible parameter values and distributions is given to illustrate how including parameter uncertainty improves the robustness of the optimal strategy at the cost of higher coverage of the population. Results derived from a stochastic programming analysis can also help to guide decisions about how much effort and resources to focus on collecting data needed to provide better estimates of key parameters. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Our model establishes that the probability of mumps virus shedding decreases rapidly after the onset of symptoms. However, we estimate that 8%-15% of patients will still be shedding the virus 5 days after the onset of symptoms and, thus, may still be contagious during this period. © 2008 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Background. Preventing household transmission of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157 (STEC O157) infection is important because of the ease of interpersonal transmission and the potential disease severity. Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of households associated with an outbreak of STEC O157 infection in South Wales, United Kingdom, in autumn 2005. We investigated whether characteristics of the primary case patient or the household were predictors for secondary household transmission of STEC O157 infection. Furthermore, we estimated the proportion of cases that might be prevented by isolation (e.g., hospitalization) of the primary case patient immediately after the microbiological diagnosis and the number of patients with STEC O157 who would need to be isolated to prevent 1 case of hemolytic uremic syndrome. Based on dates of symptom onset, case patients in households were classified as having primary, coprimary, or secondary infection. Secondary cases were considered to be preventable if the secondary case patient's symptoms started >1 incubation period (4 days) after the date of microbiological diagnosis of the primary case. Results. Eighty-nine (91%) of 98 eligible households were enrolled. Among 20 households (22%), 25 secondary cases were ascertained. Thirteen secondary cases (56%) occurred in siblings of the primary case patients; hemolytic uremic syndrome developed in 4 of these siblings. Presence of a sibling (risk ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-14.6) and young age (<5 years) of the primary case patient (risk ratio, 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-41.6) were independent predictors for households in which secondary cases occurred. Of the 15 secondary cases for which complete information was available, 7 (46%) might have been prevented. When restricting isolation to primary case patients who were aged <10 years and who had a sibling, we estimated the number of patients who would need to be isolated to prevent 1 case of hemolytic uremic syndrome to be 47 patients (95% confidence interval, 16-78 patients). Conclusions. Promptly separating pediatric patients with STEC O157 infection from their young siblings should be considered. © 2008 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

T1  - Simple criteria for finding (nearly) optimal vaccination strategies
A1  - Tennenbaum S. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Strategies for best controlling the spread of the diseases with limited vaccine available are explored. I use influenza as a representative disease in point. The model describes the dynamics of influenza spread among multiple groups that have different risks and activity levels. I define a core group consisting of individuals with occupations that brings them in contact with many other people in a day. These occupations may include service industries, teachers, health care, and government workers, to name a few. High-risk individuals are those as typically designated for: children under 5 and adults over 50, people with weakened immune systems as well as emergency and health care personnel. Under certain conditions, shifting vaccination resources away from the high-risk group to the high-activity group will result in improved herd immunity in both the high-risk group and the population as whole. This results in more high-risk people protected even though less of them are being vaccinated, with the obvious implications that current vaccination policies may be far less then optimal. I show that the criteria for the optimal strategy can be derived from simple expressions gleaned from the expression for the basic reproductive number. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background. On 21 May 2005, the Norwegian health authorities were alerted by officials from a local hospital that several recent patients had received the diagnosis of legionnaires disease; all patients resided in 2 neighboring municipalities. We investigated the outbreak to identify the source and to implement control measures. Methods. We interviewed all surviving case patients and investigated and harvested samples from 23 businesses with cooling towers and other potential infection sources. The locations of the businesses and the patients' residences and movements were mapped. We calculated attack rates and risk ratios among people living within various radii of each potential source. Isolates of Legionella pneumophila were compared using molecular methods. Results. Among 56 case patients, 10 died. The case patients became ill 12-25 May, resided up to 20 km apart, and had not visited places in common. Those living up to 1 km from a particular air scrubber had the highest risk ratio, and only for this source did the risk ratio decrease as the radius widened. Genetically identical L. pneumophila serogroup 1 isolates were recovered from patients and the air scrubber. The air scrubber is an industrial pollution-control device that cleans air for dust particles by spraying with water. The circulating water had a high organic content, pH of 8-9, and temperature of 40degreeC. The air was expelled at 20 m/s and contained a high amount of aerosolized water. Conclusions. The high velocity, large drift, and high humidity in the air scrubber may have contributed to the wide spread of Legionella species, probably for >10 km. The risk of Legionella spread from air scrubbers should be assessed. © 2007 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background. In developing countries, there are few data that characterize the disease burden attributable to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and clearly define which age group to target for vaccine intervention. Methods. Six hundred thirty-five children, recruited during the period 2002-2003, were intensively monitored until each experienced 3 epidemics of RSV infection. RSV infection was diagnosed using immunofluorescence of nasal washing specimens collected at each episode of acute respiratory infection. Incidence estimates were adjusted for seasonality of RSV exposure. Results. For 1187 child-years of observation (CYO), a total of 409 (365 primary and 82 repeat) episodes of RSV infection were identified. Adjusted incidence estimates of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), severe LRTI, and hospital admission were 90 cases per 1000 CYO, 43 cases per 1000 CYO, and 10 cases per 1000 CYO, respectively, and corresponding estimates among infants were 104 cases per 1000 CYO, 66 cases per 1000 CYO, and 13 cases per 1000 CYO, respectively. The proportion of cases of all-cause LRTI, and severe LRTI and hospitalizations attributable to RSV in the cohort was 13%, 19%, and 5%, respectively. Fifty-five percent to 65% of RSV-associated LRTI and severe LRTI occurred in children aged >6 months. The risk of RSV disease following primary symptomatic infection remained significant beyond the first year of life, and one-quarter of all reinfections were associated with LRTI. Conclusions. RSV accounts for a substantial proportion of the total respiratory disease in this rural population; we estimate that 85,000 cases of severe LRTI per year occur in infants in Kenya. The majority of this morbidity occurs during late infancy and early childhood - ages at which the risk of disease following infection remains significant. Disease resulting from reinfection is common. Our results inform the debate on the target age group and effectiveness of a vaccine. © 2007 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

T1  - No HIV stage is dominant in driving the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa
A1  - Abu-Raddad L.J.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the role of each of the HIV progression stages in fueling HIV transmission in sub-Saharan Africa by using the recent measurements of HIV transmission probability per coital per HIV stage in the Rakai study. METHOD(S): A mathematical model, parameterized by empirical data from the Rakai, Masaka, and Four-City studies, was used to estimate the proportion of infections due to each of the HIV stages in two representative epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. The first setting represents a hyperendemic HIV epidemic (Kisumu, Kenya) whereas the second setting represents a generalized but not hyperendemic HIV epidemic (Yaounde, Cameroon). RESULT(S): We estimate that 17, 51, and 32% of HIV transmissions in Kisumu were due to index cases in their acute, latent, and late stages, respectively. In Yaounde, the fractions were 25, 44, and 31%. We found that the relative contribution of each stage varied with the epidemic evolution with the acute stage prevailing early on when the infection is concentrated in the high-risk groups with the late stage playing a major role as the epidemic matured and stabilized. The latent stage contribution remained largely stable throughout the epidemic and contributed about half of all transmissions. CONCLUSION(S): No HIV stage dominated the epidemical though the latent stage provided the largest contribution. The role of each stage depends on the phase of the epidemic and on the prevailing levels of sexual risk behavior in the populations in which HIV is spreading. These findings may influence the design and implementation of different HIV interventions. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Reducing viral load, highly active antiretroviral therapy has the potential to limit onwards transmission of HIV-1 and thus help contain epidemic spread. However, increases in risk behaviour and resurgent epidemics have been widely reported post-highly active antiretroviral therapy. The aim of this study was to quantify the impact that highly active antiretroviral therapy had on the epidemic. DESIGN: We focus on the HIV-1 epidemic among men who have sex with men in the Netherlands, which has been well documented over the past 20 years within several long-standing national surveillance programs. METHOD(S): We used a mathematical model including highly active antiretroviral therapy use and estimated the changes in risk behaviour and diagnosis rate needed to explain annual data on HIV and AIDS diagnoses. RESULT(S): We show that the reproduction number R(t), a measure of the state of the epidemic, declined early on from initial values above two and was maintained below one from 1985 to 2000. Since 1996, when highly active antiretroviral therapy became widely used, the risk behaviour rate has increased 66%, resulting in an increase of R(t) to 1.04 in the latest period 2000-2004 (95% confidence interval 0.98-1.09) near or just above the threshold for a self-sustaining epidemic. Hypothetical scenario analysis shows that the epidemiological benefits of highly active antiretroviral therapy and earlier diagnosis on incidence have been entirely offset by increases in the risk behaviour rate. CONCLUSION(S): We provide the first detailed quantitative analysis of the HIV epidemic in a well defined population and find a resurgent epidemic in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy, most likely predominantly caused by increasing sexual risk behaviour. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

T1  - The theoretical influence of immunity between strain groups on the progression of drug-resistant tuberculosis epidemics
A1  - Basu S.
A1  - Orenstein E.
A1  - Galvani A.P. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Background. Emerging research suggests that genetically distinct strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis may modulate the immune system differently. This may be of importance in high-burden settings where 1 genetic group of M. tuberculosis confers significant morbidity. Methods. A dynamic mathematical model was constructed to evaluate how different degrees of cross-immunity among M. tuberculosis groups could affect epidemics of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). Results. Simulated populations with immunogenically distinct TB strain groups experienced a heightened risk of drug-resistant TB, compared with populations without such strain diversity, even when the same rates of case detection and treatment success were achieved. The highest risks of infection were observed in populations in which HIV was prevalent. Drug-resistant strains with very low transmission fitness could still propagate in environments with reduced cross-immunity among different strain groups, even after common targets for case detection and treatment success are reached. Conclusions. It is possible that the propagation of drug-resistant strains could depend not only on the rate of development of resistance and the fitness of the drug-resistant strains but, also, on the diversity of the strains in the region. The risk of infection with drug-resistant strains could be amplified in locations where there is reduced cross-immunity between originating strain groups. This amplification may be most profound during the first few decades of TB treatment expansion. © 2008 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

N2  - Aims: The aim of this study was to examine alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms among hospital employees exposed to a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, and the relationship between types of exposure to the SARS outbreak and subsequent alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms. Method(s): A survey was conducted among 549 randomly selected hospital employees in Beijing, China, concerning the psychological impact of the 2003 SARS outbreak. Subjects were assessed on sociodemographic factors and types of exposure to the outbreak, and on symptoms of post-traumatic stress (PTS), alcohol abuse/dependence and depression. Result(s): Current alcohol abuse/dependence symptom counts 3 years after the outbreak were positively associated with having been quarantined, or worked in high-risk locations such as SARS wards, during the outbreak. However, having had family members or friends contract, SARS was not related to alcohol abuse/dependence symptom count. Symptoms of PTS and of depression, and having used drinking as a coping method, were also significantly associated with increased alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms. The relationship between outbreak exposure and alcohol abuse/ dependence symptom count remained significant even when sociodemographic and other factors were controlled for. When the intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal PTS symptom clusters were entered into the model, hyperarousal was found to be significantly associated with alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms. Conclusion(s): Exposure to an outbreak of a severe infectious disease can, like other disaster exposures, lead not only to PTSD but also to other psychiatric conditions, such as alcohol abuse/dependence. The findings will help policy makers and health professionals to better prepare for potential outbreaks of diseases such as SARS or avian flu.

N2  - Background. Shigella species infect ~450,000 persons annually in the United States. Person-to-person transmission of Shigella species, which have a low infectious dose, occurs frequently, particularly in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene. Sexual transmission of Shigella species among men who have sex with men (MSM) has been inferred from outbreaks of shigellosis among that population, and limited studies have suggested the importance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection as a risk factor for shigellosis. No population-based study of sporadic shigellosis has evaluated the role of sexual practices (especially among MSM) and HIV infection along with other established risk factors for shigellosis. Methods. We conducted a population-based case-control study of shigellosis in adults in San Francisco, California, during the period 1998-1999. Cases of Shigella infection were identified through laboratory-based active surveillance conducted by the California Emerging Infections Program. Seventy-six case patients were matched by sex with 146 control subjects. Exposure data were collected on established risk factors, sexual practices, and HIV infection status. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were conducted. Population-attributable fractions were calculated. Results. From the multivariable analysis, for men, shigellosis was associated with MSM (odds ratio [OR], 8.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.70-25.2), HIV infection (OR, 8.17; 95% CI, 2.71-24.6), direct oral-anal contact (OR, 7.50; 95% CI, 1.74-32.3), and foreign travel (OR, 20.0; 95% CI, 5.26-76.3), with population-attributable fractions of 0.72, 0.42, 0.31, and 0.18, respectively. For women, shigellosis was associated only with foreign travel (OR, 21.0; 95% CI, 2.52-899), with a population-attributable fraction of 0.37. Conclusions. Among MSM, shigellosis is predominantly a sexually transmitted disease, with direct oral-anal contact conferring the highest risk and HIV infection likely contributing to increased host susceptibility. © 2006 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

N2  - Whether it is infections that we are called on to treat or those that we inadvertently cause, surgeons encounter infectious morbidity and mortality on a daily basis. It is estimated that by the year 2030, the US population aged 65 and older will reach 72 million, double that of year 2000.177 As the population ages, the medical community must adapt accordingly. The aging population will require more medical resources and will be at greater risk for the development of nosocomial infection.178 As a result, the balance between medical progress and the subsequent consequences will inevitably continue. We have seen an explosion in the prevalence of MDR pathogens in the last decade. Additionally, we are currently witnessing an epidemic of a new deadly strain of C. difficile that seemingly causes more virulent colitis and is more difficult to treat than ever before. Undoubtedly, both are the consequence of widespread antibiotic abuse. Although clinical and basic science research efforts will continue to advance our treatment of these iatrogenic consequences, as technology evolves, so too will the organisms they are designed to combat. As such, we have a responsibility, not only to our patients, but to the community at large, to practice rational, evidence-based use of antibiotics. Through careful patient selection, antibiotic choices, and shortened durations of therapy, the goal in treatment of surgical infectious disease must be to eradicate infection while preventing the transmission of antimicrobial resistance and iatrogenic disease. © 2007 Mosby, Inc.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Dengue is a serious emerging or re-emerging infectious disease that is endemic in over 100 countries. There has been an estimated of 50 million infection per year globally with more than 2.5 billion people are at risk for epidemic transmission. The major burden for dengue is in the south-east Asia and the western Pacific although there have been increasing reports of this disease in the Americas. This infectious disease is caused by the dengue virus which is a member of the Flaviviridae and is spread by the highly domesticated Aedes aegypti mosquito. There are two principal illnesses associated with dengue which are Dengue Fever (DF) and Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF). The former is a flu-like illness with symptoms like fever, headaches, joint aches and rashes while the latter is more severe and often fatal complication of DF as a result of the dengue shock syndrome (DSS). To date, there is no licensed vaccine or therapeutic drug available for DF and DHF/DSS, although there have been reports of some vaccine candidates in clinical trials. The treatment for DF and DFF/DSS has only been supportive thus far. This paper discusses the protein of the dengue virus as well as reviews some of the work and strategies that have been carried out in the quest for finding vaccines and therapeutic drugs for dengue, particularly those employing computer-aided approaches. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

N2  - Background: On a macrosocial level, neighborhood characteristics have been found to be associated with the prevalence of HIV and other bloodborne and sexually transmitted infections. The current study used structural equation modeling to examine the relationship between neighborhood social and physical disorder and high-risk sexual partners. Method(s): A cohort (N=838) recruited for an HIV prevention study of drug users (2002-2004) in Baltimore, Maryland, was interviewed about their neighborhood characteristics, drug use, depressive symptoms (using the Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), and HIV/sexually transmitted infection risk behaviors of exchanging sex for money or drugs, having multiple sexual partners, and having partners who injected drugs or smoked crack cocaine. Data were analyzed in February 2005. Result(s): Model fit statistics from Mplus (Muthen & Muthen, Los Angeles CA, 2004) indicated statistically significant direct associations between neighborhood disorder and psychologic distress, neighborhood disorder and sexual risk behaviors, and neighborhood disorder and drug use. There were also significant indirect associations of neighborhood disorder on sexual risk behaviors. Conclusion(s): These results highlight the importance of viewing drug use, chronic stress, depression and hopelessness, and infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C as interlinked epidemics that are fostered by neighborhood social and physical disorder. Neighborhood, network, and community level interventions are needed to address these intertwined public health issues. © 2007 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

T1  - Some properties of a simple stochastic epidemic model of SIR type
A1  - Tuckwell H.C.
A1  - Williams R.J. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - We investigate the properties of a simple discrete time stochastic epidemic model. The model is Markovian of the SIR type in which the total population is constant and individuals meet a random number of other individuals at each time step. Individuals remain infectious for R time units, after which they become removed or immune. Individual transition probabilities from susceptible to diseased states are given in terms of the binomial distribution. An expression is given for the probability that any individuals beyond those initially infected become diseased. In the model with a finite recovery time R, simulations reveal large variability in both the total number of infected individuals and in the total duration of the epidemic, even when the variability in number of contacts per day is small. In the case of no recovery, R = , a formal diffusion approximation is obtained for the number infected. The mean for the diffusion process can be approximated by a logistic which is more accurate for larger contact rates or faster developing epidemics. For finite R we then proceed mainly by simulation and investigate in the mean the effects of varying the parameters p (the probability of transmission), R, and the number of contacts per day per individual. A scale invariant property is noted for the size of an outbreak in relation to the total population size. Most notable are the existence of maxima in the duration of an epidemic as a function of R and the extremely large differences in the sizes of outbreaks which can occur for small changes in R. These findings have practical applications in controlling the size and duration of epidemics and hence reducing their human and economic costs. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - A small proportion of air travelers make disproportionately more journeys than the rest of travelers. They also tend to interact predominantly with other frequent travelers in hotels and airport lounges. This group has the potential to accelerate global spread of infectious respiratory diseases. Using an epidemiologic model, we simulated exportation of cases from severe acute respiratory syndrome-like and influenza-like epidemics in a population for which a small proportion travel more frequently than the rest. Our simulations show that frequent travelers accelerate international spread of epidemics only if they are infected early in an outbreak and the outbreak does not expand rapidly. If the epidemic growth rate is high, as is likely for pandemic influenza, heterogeneities in travel are frequently overwhelmed by the large number of infected persons in the majority population and the resulting high probability that some of these persons will take an international flight.

T1  - Accounting for biological variability and sampling scale: A multi-scale approach to building epidemic models
A1  - Soubeyrand S.
A1  - Thebaud G.
A1  - Chadoeuf J. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - When one considers the fine-scale spread of an epidemic, one usually knows the sources of biological variability and their qualitative effect on the epidemic process. The force of infection on a susceptible unit depends on the locations and the strengths of the infectious units, and on the environmental and intrinsic factors affecting infectivity and/or susceptibility. The infection probability for the susceptible unit can then be modelled as a function of these factors. Thus, one can build a conceptual model at the fine scale. However, the epidemic is generally observed at a larger scale and one has to build a model adapted to this larger scale. But how can the sources of variation identified at the fine scale be integrated into the model at the larger scale? To answer this question, we present, in the context of plant epidemiology, a multi-scale approach which consists of defining a base model built at the fine scale and upscaling it to match the scale of the sampling and the data. This approach will enable comparing experiments involving different observational processes. © 2007 The Royal Society.

T1  - Current risks of transfusion-transmitted agents: A review
A1  - Stramer S.L. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Context. - Infectious disease testing has dramatically improved the safety of blood for transfusion in the United States, especially since the introduction in 1999 of nucleic acid amplification testing. In 2004, methods (primarily culturing) for detecting bacteria in platelets were also added. Objective. - To provide current risk estimates for the likelihood of viral transmission by test-negative blood components and to illustrate the safety improvements since the introduction of bacterial testing of platelets. Data Sources. - Published literature from 1999 through 2006 and unpublished American Red Cross data sources. Conclusions. - The risk of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus transmission through blood transfusion since the introduction of nucleic acid amplification testing is approximately 1 in 2 million. Hepatitis B virus risk, for which nucleic acid amplification testing is not performed routinely, remains at 1 in 200 000 to 500 000 using a combination of anti-hepatitis B core and hepatitis B surface antigen testing. Seven cases of transfusion-transmitted West Nile virus have been reported since the introduction of nucleic acid amplification testing in 2003, but none has been reported since system-wide implementation of processes to increase the test sensitivity for use in epidemic areas. The residual risk of receiving a bacterially contaminated platelet component with clinical consequences is estimated at approximately 1 in 75 000, if culture negative and 1 in 33 000 if not tested by culture methods.

T1  - Comparing methods to quantify experimental transmission of infectious agents
A1  - Velthuis A.G.J.
A1  - De Jong M.C.M.
A1  - De Bree J. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Transmission of an infectious agent can be quantified from experimental data using the transient-state (TS) algorithm. The TS algorithm is based on the stochastic SIR model and provides a time-dependent probability distribution over the number of infected individuals during an epidemic, with no need for the experiment to end in final-size (e.g., where no more infections can occur). Because of numerical limitations, the application of the TS algorithm is limited to populations with only a few individuals. We investigated the error of using the easily applicable, time-independent final-size (FS) algorithm knowing that the FS situation was not reached. We conclude that the methods based on the FS algorithm: (i) underestimate R0, (ii) are liberal when testing H0:R0 >= 1 against H1:R0 < 1, (iii) are conservative when testing H0:R0 <= 1 against H1:R0 > 1, and (iv) are conservative when testing H0:Rcontrol = Rtreatment against H1:Rcontrol > Rtreatment. Furthermore, a new method is presented to find a difference in transmission between two treatment groups (MaxDiff test). The MaxDiff test is compared to tests based on FS and TS algorithms. The TS test and the MaxDiff test were most powerful (approximately equally powerful) in finding a difference, whereas the FS test was less powerful (especially, when both Rcontrol and Rtreatment are >1). © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Epidemics of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in major Brazilian cities are new phenomena since 1980. As determinants of transmission in urban settings probably operate at different geographic scales, and information is not available for each scale, a multilevel approach was used to examine the effect of canine infection and environmental and socio-economic factors on the spatial variability of incidence rates of VL in the city of Teresina. Details on an outbreak of greater than 1200 cases of VL in Teresina during 1993-1996 were available at two hierarchical levels: census tracts (socio-economic characteristics, incidence rates of human VL) and districts, which encompass census tracts (prevalence of canine infection). Remotely sensed data obtained by satellite generated environmental information at both levels. Data from census tracts and districts were analysed simultaneously by multilevel modelling. Poor socio-economic conditions and increased vegetation were associated with a high incidence of human VL. Increasing prevalence of canine infection also predicted a high incidence of human VL, as did high prevalence of canine infection before and during the epidemic. Poor socio-economic conditions had an amplifying effect on the association between canine infection and the incidence of human VL. Focusing interventions on areas with characteristics identified by multilevel analysis could be a cost-effective strategy for controlling VL. Because risk factors for infectious diseases operate simultaneously at several levels and ecological data usually are available at different geographical scales, multilevel modelling is a valuable tool for epidemiological investigation of disease transmission. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

N2  - Identifying links between environmental variables and infectious disease risk is essential to understanding how human-induced environmental changes will effect the dynamics of human and wildlife diseases. Although land cover change has often been tied to spatial variation in disease occurrence, the underlying factors driving the correlations are often unknown, limiting the applicability of these results for disease prevention and control. In this study, we described associations between land cover composition and West Nile virus (WNV) infection prevalence, and investigated three potential processes accounting for observed patterns: (1) variation in vector density; (2) variation in amplification host abundance; and (3) variation in host community composition. Interestingly, we found that WNV infection rates among Culex mosquitoes declined with increasing wetland cover, but wetland area was not significantly associated with either vector density or amplification host abundance. By contrast, wetland area was strongly correlated with host community composition, and model comparisons suggested that this factor accounted, at least partially, for the observed effect of wetland area on WNV infection risk. Our results suggest that preserving large wetland areas, and by extension, intact wetland bird communities, may represent a valuable ecosystem-based approach for controlling WNV outbreaks. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Background. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) has emerged as a global epidemic, with ~425,000 new cases estimated to occur annually. The global human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection epidemic has caused explosive increases in TB incidence and may be contributing to increases in MDR-TB prevalence. Methods. We reviewed published studies and available surveillance data evaluating links between HIV infection and MDR-TB to quantify convergence of these 2 epidemics, evaluate the consequences, and determine essential steps to address these epidemics. Results. Institutional outbreaks of MDR-TB have primarily affected HIV-infected persons. Delayed diagnosis, inadequate initial treatment, and prolonged infectiousness led to extraordinary attack rates and case-fatality rates among HIV-infected persons. Whether this sequence occurs in communities is less clear. MDR-TB appears not to cause infection or disease more readily than drug-susceptible TB in HIV-infected persons. HIV infection may lead to malabsorption of anti-TB drugs and acquired rifamycin resistance. HIV-infected patients with MDR-TB have unacceptably high mortality; both antiretroviral and antimycobacterial treatment are necessary. Simultaneous treatment requires 6-10 different drugs. In HIV-prevalent countries, TB programs struggle with increased caseloads, which increase the risk of acquired MDR-TB. Surveillance data suggest that HIV infection and MDR-TB may converge in several countries. Conclusions. Institutional outbreaks, overwhelmed public health programs, and complex clinical management issues may contribute to the convergence of the MDR-TB and HIV infection epidemics. To forestall disastrous consequences, infection control, rapid case detection, effective treatment, and expanded program capacity are needed urgently. © 2007 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

T1  - Transmission of bovine leukaemia virus within dairy herds by simulation modelling

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - In Argentina, bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) infection is common in dairy herds. The country currently has a National Voluntary Control Programme but relatively few farms have enrolled. However, there is increased interest from authorities and farmers to implement regional compulsory programmes but there is scarce quantitative information of the transmission of BLV in cattle herds. This information is a prerequisite to develop effective BLV control strat egies. Mathematical modelling offers ways of integrating population-level knowledge and epidemiological data to predict the outcomes of intervention scenarios. The purpose of the current paper is to gain understanding about the dynamics of the transmission of BLV in dairy herds from Argentina by simulation and to compare various BLV transmission models and select the one that is most appropriate. The hypothetical herd is conceptually described in terms of BLV status as a population of individuals that are protected by maternal antibodies (M), that are susceptible (S), that are in the latent period (E) or that are infectious (I). BLV is spread by horizontal and vertical transmission. We used an age-structured population model and withinherd transmission was simulated by Monte Carlo techniques. The next-generation approach has been used for the systematic computation of the basic reproduction ratio (R0). Parameter values for disease transmission were derived from previously published data; rates of entry, exit or transition between age groups were calculated based on our previous study, observational data, expert opinions and literature. With these parameter values the probability of a minor outbreak was estimated to be 10%, the probability of extinction was estimated as <0.001% and the expected time to extinction as more than 80 years. The probability of a minor outbreak and changes in prevalence were different when the index case was an adult cow compared to introduction by a heifer. Prediction of prevalences from MSI models fit the data satisfactorily. R0 was estimated as 9.5. The sensitivity analysis on R0 showed that all measures directed to reduce the transmission rate are potentially effective given operational control measures. An important prediction of these models is that, even in a relatively small, closed dairy herd the time-scale for a BLV outbreak may be as long as several years and within-herd control of BLV requires intensive efforts. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.

T1  - Epidemic outbreaks on structured populations
A1  - Vazquez A. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Our chances to halt epidemic outbreaks rely on how accurately we represent the population structure underlying the disease spread. When analysing global epidemics this force us to consider metapopulation models taking into account intra- and inter-community interactions. Here I introduce and analyze a metapopulation model which accounts for several features observed in real outbreaks. First, I demonstrate that depending on the intra-community expected outbreak size and the fraction of social bridges the epidemic outbreaks die out or there is a finite probability to observe a global epidemics. Second, I show that the global scenario is characterized by resurgent epidemics, their number increasing with increasing the intra-community average distance between individuals. Finally, I present empirical data for the AIDS epidemics supporting the model predictions. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background. Listeria monocytogenes has been estimated to cause >2500 illnesses and 500 deaths annually in the United States. Efforts to reduce foodborne listeriosis have focused on foods frequently implicated in outbreaks. Potential sources for L. monocytogenes infection not associated with outbreaks remain poorly understood. Methods. The Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network conducts surveillance for culture-confirmed listeriosis at clinical laboratories in 9 states. After excluding outbreak-associated cases, we attempted to enroll eligible case patients with L. monocytogenes infection in a case-control study from 2000 through 2003. Control subjects were recruited through health care providers and were matched to case patients by state, age, and immunosuppression status. Data were collected about exposures occurring in the 4 weeks before specimen collection from the case patients. Results. Of the 249 case patients with L. monocytogenes infection, only 12 (5%) had cases that were associated with outbreaks; 6 other patients were ineligible for other reasons. Of 231 eligible case patients, 169 (73%) were enrolled in the study. We classified 28 case patients as having pregnancy-associated cases. We enrolled 376 control subjects. In multivariable analysis, L. monocytogenes infection was associated with eating melons at a commercial establishment (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-5.0) and eating hummus prepared in a commercial establishment (odds ratio, 5.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-19.1). Conclusions. Most cases of L. monocytogenes infection were not associated with outbreaks. Reducing the burden of foodborne listeriosis may require interventions directed at retail environments and at foods, such as melons and hummus, that are not commonly recognized as high risk. Because of the severity of listeriosis, pregnant women and other persons at risk may wish to avoid eating these newly implicated foods. © 2007 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

N2  - We evaluated the impacts of weather variability on the occurrence of dengue fever in a major metropolitan city, Kaohsiung, in southern Taiwan using time-series analysis. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models showed that the incidence of dengue fever was negatively associated with monthly temperature deviation (beta = -0.126, p = 0.044), and a reverse association was also found with relative humidity (beta = -0.025, p = 0.048). Both factors were observed to present their most prominent effects at a time lag of 2 months. Meanwhile, vector density record, a conventional approach often applied as a predictor for outbreak, did not appear to be a good one for diseases occurrence. Weather variability was identified as a meaningful and significant indicator for the increasing occurrence of dengue fever in this study, and it might be feasible to be adopted for predicting the influences of rising average temperature on the occurrence of infectious diseases of such kind at a city level. Further studies should take into account variations of socio-ecological changes and disease transmission patterns to better propose the increasing risk for infectious disease outbreak by applying the conveniently accumulated information of weather variability. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Early efforts in modeling the incubation period of infectious diseases with an acute course of illness
A1  - Nishiura H. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - The incubation period of infectious diseases, the time from infection with a microorganism to onset of disease, is directly relevant to prevention and control. Since explicit models of the incubation period enhance our understanding of the spread of disease, previous classic studies were revisited, focusing on the modeling methods employed and paying particular attention to relatively unknown historical efforts. The earliest study on the incubation period of pandemic influenza was published in 1919, providing estimates of the incubation period of Spanish flu using the daily incidence on ships departing from several ports in Australia. Although the study explicitly dealt with an unknown time of exposure, the assumed periods of exposure, which had an equal probability of infection, were too long, and thus, likely resulted in slight underestimates of the incubation period. After the suggestion that the incubation period follows lognormal distribution, Japanese epidemiologists extended this assumption to estimates of the time of exposure during a point source outbreak. Although the reason why the incubation period of acute infectious diseases tends to reveal a right-skewed distribution has been explored several times, the validity of the lognormal assumption is yet to be fully clarified. At present, various different distributions are assumed, and the lack of validity in assuming lognormal distribution is particularly apparent in the case of slowly progressing diseases. The present paper indicates that (1) analysis using well-defined short periods of exposure with appropriate statistical methods is critical when the exact time of exposure is unknown, and (2) when assuming a specific distribution for the incubation period, comparisons using different distributions are needed in addition to estimations using different datasets, analyses of the determinants of incubation period, and an understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms. © 2007 Nishiura; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - In the early nineties, the occurrence of hepatitis A outbreaks in some patients with haemophilia in some countries led French health authorities to recommend hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccination in HAV-seronegative haemophiliacs. The French 'Suivi therapeutique National des Hemophiles' cohort permitted to assess the implementation of this recommendation by the analysis of the vaccinal process, i.e. HAV seropositivity assessment and vaccination of HAV-seronegative patients, in a survival approach. In a subgroup of 812 patients diagnosed earlier than 1990 (prevalent cohort), the implementation of vaccinal process increased quickly from 0% in 1993 to 41.8% in 1994 and to 71.2% in 1996, suggesting a 'notification effect'. The vaccinal process was associated to three cofactors in a Cox model analysis (age, severity of haemophilia, centre of treatment). No infection was observed during the survey in this group. In another subgroup of 201 boys born since 1993 (incident cohort), 27.5% and 15.4% patients remained exposed to the risk at 3 and 5 years from diagnosis respectively, again with a 'centre effect', which might be linked to various factors such as regain in confidence for products or economic reasons. Only five infectious seroconversions were assessed over the 7-year survey, which represents 14.5 cases per 1000 person-year incidence without any relationship with products. Our data combined with the contemporary hepatitis A epidemiology and the current safety of anti-haemophilic concentrates, should lead to a new assessment of the risk of hepatitis A in haemophiliacs. We suggest that among patients with bleeding disorder, as well as in other populations, HAV prevention policy might be stressed on those who already suffer from chronic liver disease and/or travel in endemic countries. © 2007 The Authors Journal compliation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Most recent emerging infectious diseases have been zoonotic in origin. It is our contention that one of the factors responsible for such emergence is the trade in wildlife and bushmeat in particular. This article considers the effect of increasing diversity in the species hunted on the probability of global epidemics such as SARS. In particular, we develop a mathematical model of the probability of such an outbreak in terms of the number of species hunted, the number of susceptibles, and the rate of contact. Hence, we postulate that local biodiversity loss and increasing rates of animal trafficking, and trade and transportation of animals to large cities-where there is a greater potential for person-to-person transmission-may increase the probability of such outbreaks dramatically. © 2007 Ecohealth Journal Consortium.

T1  - Control and prevention of healthcare-associated tuberculosis: the role of respiratory isolation and personal respiratory protection
A1  - Humphreys H. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Although the prevalence of tuberculosis continues to decline in most developed countries, the risk of healthcare-associated tuberculosis, remains for patients or healthcare staff. Outbreaks of healthcare-associated tuberculosis are usually associated with delays in diagnosis and treatment, or the care of patients in sub-optimal facilities. The control and prevention of tuberculosis in hospitals is best achieved by three approaches, namely administrative (early investigation diagnosis, etc.), engineering (physical facilities e.g. ventilated isolation rooms) and personal respiratory protection (face sealing masks which are filtered). Recent guidelines on the prevention of tuberculosis in healthcare facilities from Europe and the USA have many common themes. In the UK, however, negative pressure isolation rooms are recommended only for patients with suspected multi-drug resistant TB and personal respiratory protection, i.e. filtered masks, are not considered necessary unless multi-drug resistant TB is suspected, or where aerosol-generating procedures are likely. In the US, the standard of care for patients with infectious tuberculosis is a negative pressure ventilated room and the use of personal respiratory protection for all healthcare workers entering the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed tuberculosis. The absence of clinical trials in this area precludes dogmatic recommendations. Nonetheless, observational studies and mathematical modelling suggest that all measures are required for effective prevention. Even when policies and facilities are optimal, there is a need to regularly review and audit these as sometimes compliance is less than optimal. The differences in recommendations may reflect the variations in epidemiology and the greater use of BCG vaccination in the UK compared with the United States. There is a strong argument for advising ventilated facilities and personal respiratory protection for the care of all patients with tuberculosis, as multi-drug tuberculosis may not always be apparent on admission, and these measures minimise transmission of all cases of TB to other patients and healthcare staff. © 2007 The Hospital Infection Society.

N2  - Background. Influenza is a viral infectious disease which has occurred in human beings since the beginning of their existence. This is still the most common infectious disease in the world. Objectives. The aim of this study was to determine and analyse factors which affect the decision about vaccination against influenza, which was done on the basis of the diagnostic survey. Material and methods. The study involved the group of 200 respondents. They were adult individuals who were vaccinated against influenza in 2000-2005. In the study, a method of diagnostic survey was used with a questionnaire as a research tool (author's own design). Statistical calculations were performed using the chi-square independence test. Results and conclusions. Information in media on the emerging epidemic was an important factor mobilizing people to vaccinate against influenza. Work in health care centres as well as the level of medical knowledge have an effect on the decision on vaccination against influenza virus, and this interrelation is statistically significant. © Copyright by Wydawnictwo Continuo.

T1  - Pre-event smallpox vaccination for healthcare workers revisited-the need for a carefully screened multidisciplinary cadre
A1  - Malone J.D. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - As healthcare institutions are a focus of smallpox transmission early in an epidemic, several mathematical models support pre-event smallpox vaccination of healthcare workers (HCWs). The deciding factor for HCW voluntary vaccination is the risk of disease exposure versus the risk of vaccine adverse events. In a United States military population, with careful screening to exclude atopic dermatitis/eczema and immunosuppression, over 1 million vaccinia (smallpox) vaccinations were delivered with one fatality attributed to vaccination. Among 37 901 United States civilian volunteer HCWs vaccinated, 100 serious adverse events were reported including 10 ischemic cardiac episodes and six myocardial infarctions - two were fatal. This older population had a higher rate of adverse events due to age-related coronary artery disease. T-cell mediated inflammatory processes induced by live vaccinia vaccination may have a role in the observed acute coronary artery events. With exclusion of individuals at risk for coronary artery disease, atopic dermatitis/eczema, and immunosuppression, HCWs can be smallpox vaccinated with minimal risk. A carefully screened multidisciplinary cadre (physician, nurse, infection control practitioner, technician), pre-event vaccinated for smallpox, will supply the necessary leadership to alleviate fear and uncertainty while limiting spread and initial mortality of smallpox. © 2007 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

T1  - Anticipating Demand for Emergency Health Services due to Medication-related Adverse Events after Rapid Mass Prophylaxis Campaigns
A1  - Hupert N.
A1  - Wattson D.
A1  - Cuomo J.
A1  - Benson S. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Objectives: Mass prophylaxis against infectious disease outbreaks carries the risk of medication-related adverse events (MRAEs). The authors sought to define the relationship between the rapidity of mass prophylaxis dispensing and the subsequent demand for emergency health services due to predictable MRAEs. Method(s): The authors created a spreadsheet-based computer model that calculates scenario-specific predicted daily MRAE rates from user inputs by applying a probability distribution to the reported timing of MRAEs. A hypothetical two- to ten-day prophylaxis campaign for one million people using recent data from both smallpox vaccination and anthrax chemoprophylaxis campaigns was modeled. Result(s): The length of a mass prophylaxis campaign plays an important role in determining the subsequent intensity in emergency services utilization due to real or suspected adverse events. A two-day smallpox vaccination scenario would produce an estimated 32,000 medical encounters and 1,960 hospitalizations, peaking at 5,246 health care encounters six days after the start of the campaign; in contrast, a ten-day campaign would lead to 41% lower peak surge, with a maximum of 3,106 encounters on the busiest day, ten days after initiation of the campaign. MRAEs with longer lead times, such as those associated with anthrax chemoprophylaxis, exhibit less variability based on campaign length (e.g., 124 out of an estimated 1,400 hospitalizations on day 20 after a two-day campaign versus 103 on day 24 after a ten-day campaign). Conclusion(s): The duration of a mass prophylaxis campaign may have a substantial impact on the timing and peak number of clinically significant MRAEs, with very short campaigns overwhelming existing emergency department (ED) capacity to treat real or suspected medication-related injuries. While better reporting of both incidence and timing of MRAEs in future prophylaxis campaigns should improve the application of this model to community-based emergency preparedness planning, these results highlight the need for coordination between public health and emergency medicine planning for infectious disease outbreaks to avoid preventable surges in ED utilization. © 2007 Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.

T1  - Theoretically estimated risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome transmission through blood transfusion during an epidemic in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China in 2003

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognized infectious disease that caused an outbreak in south China in 2003. The cause of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV). The existence of asymptomatic seroconvertors and the detection of the SARS-CoV RNA in plasma during the course of infection all suggest that SARS could, as least theoretically, be transmitted by transfusion. An estimate of the risk of SARS transmission through blood transfusion will contribute to decisions concerning blood safety monitoring and may be useful in the design of strategies to decrease the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections. Study design and methods: Case onset dates from the 2003 Shenzhen SARS epidemic and investigational results from Taiwan on viremia in humans are used to estimate the number of cases that were viremic throughout the epidemic. Estimates of the asymptomatic-to-clinically confirmed SARS-CoV infection ratio, the proportion of asymptomatic infections reported in a seroprevalence survey in Hongkong, and the population size of Shenzhen are used to infer the SARS-CoV transfusion-transmission risk. Statistical resampling methods are used. Result(s): Based on data from Shenzhen, Hongkong and Taiwan, the maximum and mean risk (per million) of SARS-CoV transmission from donors in Shenzhen were estimated as 23.57 (95% CI: 6.83-47.69) and 14.11 (95% CI: 11.00-17.22), respectively. The estimated risk peaked on April 02, 2003. Conclusion(s): Although there are currently no confirmed reports of the transmission of SARS-CoV from asymptomatic individuals, recent research data indicate that transfusion-transmitted SARS-CoV is at least theoretically possible. Although the risk is low, with its rapid spread of the disease, appearance of alarmingly high infectivity and high fatality rate, public health authorities need to consider strategies for blood donor recruitment and virus inactivation during an epidemic to further ensure blood safety. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Introduction: Funding increases after September 11, 2001 have provided impetus to improve public health emergency preparedness plans. Training of local health department staff and coordination between counties are important components of these plans. Electronic media have been used to facilitate dissemination of training, and a need for evaluation has been identified. Method(s): Public Health Investigation (PHI) was conducted in 6 Kansas counties during February 2005 in an electronic, in-office format. The quantitative evaluation consisted of pre- and postsurveys. Questions measured self-reported improvements in 4 areas: surge capacity, coordination between counties, risk communication, and protocols and procedures. Result(s): Although all 4 areas showed improvement, 2 showed statistically significant improvement. At the postsurvey, participants reported significantly improved abilities to (1) participate in a coordinated, multidisciplinary response to an infectious disease outbreak (P = .003) and (2) identify the need for and implement surge capacity (P = .017). Conclusion(s): Increased collaboration between counties and partner agencies may be the greatest strength of PHI, a multi-county, real-time exercise. This format strengthens regional bonds and is cost-effective. The PHI may be a useful model for other states wishing to use a regional approach for training, thereby strengthening regional bonds. © 2007 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

N2  - The outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Europe in 2001 identified the vulnerability of the intensive agricultural industries in Europe and North America to the economic consequences of the introduction of a highly infectious animal disease. The very large illegal international trade in animal products bypasses the safeguards recommended by World Animal Health Organization (OIE) and put in place by governments to prevent the importation of foreign pathogens. If it is not possible to stop the entry of FMD virus, what are the options to mitigate the risk by reducing the area of the globe in which FMD is endemic? There are a number of constraints that would prevent global control of FMD; current vaccines are expensive, have a narrow antigenic spectrum, provide only short term immunity and are very fragile; diagnostics are also expensive, require training to use and if not handled properly lose sensitivity and specificity; we still do not understand the significance of carrier animals in the epidemiology of FMD, and whether it is necessary or possible to prevent the carrier state; and many decision support tools, such as models are currently more dangerous than useful in that they fail to fully accommodate all the complexities of the disease. The four national foreign animal disease laboratories in USA, Canada, UK and Australia together with the International Livestock Research Institute have put forward a proposal to address some of these constraints (the Global FMD Research Alliance, GFRA), not only to protect their own national livestock industries, but also to support FMD control programs in countries in which the disease is present. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Because of the confounding effects of long incubation duration and flock management, accurate epidemiological studies of scrapie outbreaks are difficult to carry out. In this study, 641 Manech red-faced sheep from six scrapie-affected field flocks in Pyrenees Atlantiques, France, were monitored for clinical scrapie over a 6-9 year period. Over this period, 170 scrapie clinical cases were recorded and half of the culled animals were submitted for post-mortem transmissible spongiform encephalopathy diagnosis to assess their infectious status. Collected data were analysed using a 'mixture cure model' approach, which allowed for the discriminating effect of PrP genotype and flock origin on incidence and incubation period. Simulations were performed to evaluate the applicability of such a statistical model to the collected data. As expected, ARR heterozygote sheep were less at risk of becoming infected than ARQ/ARQ individuals and had a greater age at clinical onset. Conversely, when compared with ARQ/ARQ, the VRQ haplotype was associated with an increased infection risk, but not a shorter incubation period. Considering the flock effect, we observed that a high incidence rate was not associated with shorter incubation periods and that the incubation period could be significantly different in flocks harbouring similar infection risks. These results strongly support the conclusion that other parameters, such as the nature of the agent or flock management, could interfere with epidemiological dynamics of the infection in scrapie-affected flocks. © 2007 SGM.

T1  - Network-based analysis of stochastic SIR epidemic models with random and proportionate mixing
A1  - Kenah E.
A1  - Robins J.M. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - In this paper, we outline the theory of epidemic percolation networks and their use in the analysis of stochastic susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) epidemic models on undirected contact networks. We then show how the same theory can be used to analyze stochastic SIR models with random and proportionate mixing. The epidemic percolation networks for these models are purely directed because undirected edges disappear in the limit of a large population. In a series of simulations, we show that epidemic percolation networks accurately predict the mean outbreak size and probability and final size of an epidemic for a variety of epidemic models in homogeneous and heterogeneous populations. Finally, we show that epidemic percolation networks can be used to re-derive classical results from several different areas of infectious disease epidemiology. In an Appendix, we show that an epidemic percolation network can be defined for any time-homogeneous stochastic SIR model in a closed population and prove that the distribution of outbreak sizes given the infection of any given node in the SIR model is identical to the distribution of its out-component sizes in the corresponding probability space of epidemic percolation networks. We conclude that the theory of percolation on semi-directed networks provides a very general framework for the analysis of stochastic SIR models in closed populations. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Developing countries face the double menace of still prevalent infectious diseases and increasing cardiovascular disease (CVD) with epidemic proportions in the near future, linked to demographic changes (expansion and ageing), and to urbanisation and lifestyle modifications. It is estimated that the elderly population will increase globally (over 80% during the next 25 years), with a large share of this rise in the developing world because of expanding populations. Increasing longevity prolongs the time exposure to risk factors, resulting in a greater probability of CVD. As a paradox, increased longevity due to improved social and economical conditions associated with lifestyle changes in the direction of a rich diet and sedentary habits in the last century, is one of the main contributors to the incremental trend in CVD. The variable increase rate of CVD in different nations may reflect different stages of "epidemiological transition" and it is probable that the relatively slow changes seen in developing populations through the epidemiological transition may occur at an accelerated pace in individuals migrating from nations in need to affluent societies (i.e. Hispanics to the USA, Africans to Europe). Because of restrained economic conditions in the developing world, the greatest gains in controlling the CVD epidemic lies in its prevention. Healthy foods should be widely available and affordable, and healthy dietary practices such as increased consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, reduced consumption of saturated fat, salt, and simple sugars, may be promoted in all populations. Specific strategies for smoking and overweight control may be regulation of marketed tobacco and unhealthy fast food and promotion of an active lifestyle. Greater longevity and economic progress are accompanied by an increasing burden of CVD and other chronic diseases with an important decrease in quality of life, which should question the benefit of these additional years without quality.

T1  - Containing acute disease outbreak
A1  - Prince A.
A1  - Chen X.
A1  - Lun K.C. 
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Objective: The objectives of epidemiological surveillance and research of infectious diseases are to address disease prevention, identify outbreaks and monitor and evaluate control strategies. In this paper, we report on the development of a Geographical Information System (GIS) based on a novel Digital Ring Fence (DRIF) strategy for the containment of acute infectious diseases. Method(s): Data from probable cases ore captured in a secure database. Postal codes of addresses facilitate precise mapping of the location of each probable case on a multi-layered GIS system, A digital ring fence is constructed around each location (hot-spot) using Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP) modeling based on data of individuals coming into contact with each probable case. The radius of the DRIF gives the overall risk of infection from its epicenter, the probable case. By annotating the DRIF to a GIS, erees of population concentrations could be readily identified to direct outbreak containment efforts,. Result(s): Simulation studies have demonstrated that the DRIF strategy could provide a novel approach to containment of acute disease outbreaks. Conclusion(s): SARS has provided convincing evidence that the key to tackling acute infectious disease outbreaks lies in containment and making disease containment one step ahead of its spread. The DRIF strategy achieves this by providing a zone to corral the spread of infection erough person-to-person transmission. Other useful applications of the DRIF technique include demarcating culling zone for the containment of bird flu infection and containment of person-to-persen transmission should it occur. © 2005 Schattauer GmbH.

T1  - Washing our hands of the congenital cytomegalovirus disease epidemic
A1  - Cannon M.J.
A1  - Davis K.F. 
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Background: Each year in the United States, an estimated 40,000 children are born with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, causing an estimated 400 deaths and leaving approximately 8000 children with permanent disabilities such as hearing or vision loss, or mental retardation. More children are affected by serious CMV-related disabilities than by several better-known childhood maladies, including Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, and spina bifida. Discussion(s): Congenital CMV is a prime target for prevention not only because of its substantial disease burden but also because the biology and epidemiology of CMV suggest that there are ways to reduce viral transmission. Because exposure to the saliva or urine of young children is a major cause of CMV infection among pregnant women, it is likely that good personal hygiene, especially hand-washing, can reduce the risk of CMV acquisition. Experts agree that such measures are likely to be efficacious (i.e., they will work if consistently followed) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that physicians counsel pregnant women about preventing CMV acquisition through careful attention to hygiene. However, because of concerns about effectiveness (i.e., Will women consistently follow hygienic practices as the result of interventions?), the medical and public health communities appear reluctant to embrace primary CMV prevention via improved hygienic practices, and educational interventions are rare. Current data on the effectiveness of such measures in preventing CMV infection are promising, but limited. There is strong evidence, however, that educational interventions can prevent other infectious diseases with similar transmission modes, suggesting that effective interventions can also be found for CMV. Until a CMV vaccine becomes available, effective educational interventions are needed to inform women about congenital CMV prevention. Summary: Perhaps no single cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United States currently provides greater opportunity for improved outcomes in more children than congenital CMV. Given the present state of knowledge, women deserve to be informed about how they can reduce their risk of CMV infection during pregnancy, and trials are needed to identify effective educational interventions. © 2005 Cannon and Davis; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

T1  - The network of sheep movements within Great Britain: Network properties and their implications for infectious disease spread
A1  - Kiss I.Z.
A1  - Green D.M.
A1  - Kao R.R. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - During the 2001 foot and mouth disease epidemic in the UK, initial dissemination of the disease to widespread geographical regions was attributed to livestock movement, especially of sheep. In response, recording schemes to provide accurate data describing the movement of large livestock in Great Britain (GB) were introduced. Using these data, we reconstruct directed contact networks within the sheep industry and identify key epidemiological properties of these networks. There is clear seasonality in sheep movements, with a peak of intense activity in August and September and an associated high risk of a large epidemic. The high correlation between the in and out degree of nodes favours disease transmission. However, the contact networks were largely dissasortative: highly connected nodes mostly connect to nodes with few contacts, effectively slowing the spread of disease. This is a result of bipartite-like network properties, with most links occurring between highly active markets and less active farms. When comparing sheep movement networks (SMNs) to randomly generated networks with the same number of nodes and node degrees, despite structural differences (such as disassortativity and higher frequency of even path lengths in the SMNs), the characteristic path lengths within the SMNs are close to values computed from the corresponding random networks, showing that SMNs have 'small-world'-like properties. Using the network properties, we show that targeted biosecurity or surveillance at highly connected nodes would be highly effective in preventing a large and widespread epidemic. © 2006 The Royal Society.

T1  - Harvesting can increase severity of wildlife disease epidemics
A1  - Choisy M.
A1  - Rohani P. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Theoretical studies of wildlife population dynamics have proved insightful for sustainable management, where the principal aim is to maximize short-term yield, without risking population extinction. Surprisingly, infectious diseases have not been accounted for in harvest models, which is a major oversight because the consequences of parasites for host population dynamics are well-established. Here, we present a simple general model for a host species subject to density dependent reproduction and seasonal demography. We assume this host species is subject to infection by a strongly immunizing, directly transmitted pathogen. In this context, we show that the interaction between density dependent effects and harvesting can substantially increase both disease prevalence and the absolute number of infectious individuals. This effect clearly increases the risk of cross-species disease transmission into domestic and livestock populations. In addition, if the disease is associated with a risk of mortality, then the synergistic interaction between hunting and disease-induced death can increase the probability of host population extinction. © 2006 The Royal Society.

T1  - Joint spatial analysis of gastrointestinal infectious diseases
A1  - Held L.

A1  - Frank C.
A1  - Rue H. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - A major obstacle in the spatial analysis of infectious disease surveillance data is the problem of under-reporting. This article investigates the possibility of inferring reporting rates through joint statistical modelling of several infectious diseases with different aetiologies. Once variation in under-reporting can be estimated, geographic risk patterns for infections associated with specific food vehicles may be discerned. We adopt the shared component model, proposed by Knorr-Held and Best for two chronic diseases and further extended by (Held L, Natario I, Fenton S, Rue H, Becker N. Towards joint disease mapping. Statistical Methods in Medical Research 2005b; 14: 61-82) for more than two chronic diseases to the infectious disease setting. Our goal is to estimate a shared component, common to all diseases, which may be interpreted as representing the spatial variation in reporting rates. Additional components are introduced to describe the real spatial variation of the different diseases. Of course, this interpretation is only allowed under specific assumptions, in particular, the geographical variation in under-reporting should be similar for the diseases considered. In addition, it is vital that the data do not contain large local outbreaks, so adjustment based on a time series method recently proposed by (Held L, Hohle M, Hofmann M. A statistical framework for the analysis of multivariate infectious disease surveillance data. Statistical Modelling 2005a; 5: 187-99) is made at a preliminary stage. We will illustrate our approach through the analysis of gastrointestinal diseases notification data obtained from the German infectious disease surveillance system, administered by the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin.

T1  - Basic reproduction number for HIV model incorporating commercial sex and behavior change
A1  - Hsieh Y.H.
A1  - Wang Y.S. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - The basic reproduction number is obtained for an HIV epidemic model incorporating direct and indirect commercial sex as well as behavior change by the female commercial sex workers (CSWs) and their male customers in response to the proliferation of the disease in the community. A recent result by van den Driessche P., and Watmough J. (Math. Biosci. 180:29-48, 2002) is utilized to compute the threshold parameters for the local asymptotic stability of the Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE), by considering the transfers in and out of the infective classes. Numerical examples are used to describe the uniqueness and global properties of the endemic equilibrium when DFE is unstable. Biological interpretation of the results obtained in this work is discussed, as are the implications of our results for the design of public health policies such as targeting strategy to target intervention and control measures toward specific high-risk population groups in order to reduce infections. We show that targeting any one sector of the commercial sex alone for prevention will be difficult to have a decided effect on eradicating the epidemic. However, if the aim of the targeted intervention policy is not eradication of the epidemic but decrease in HIV incidence of a particular high-risk group, then concentrated targeting strategy could be sufficient, if properly implemented. This work also demonstrates the usefulness of the theorem of van den Driessche and Watmough (Math. Biosci. 180:29-48, 2002) in obtaining threshold parameters for complicated infectious diseases models.

T1  - Transmission assumptions generate conflicting predictions in host-vector disease models: a case study in West Nile virus

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - This review synthesizes the conflicting outbreak predictions generated by different biological assumptions in host-vector disease models. It is motivated by the North American outbreak of West Nile virus, an emerging infectious disease that has prompted at least five dynamical modelling studies. Mathematical models have long proven successful in investigating the dynamics and control of infectious disease systems. The underlying assumptions in these epidemiological models determine their mathematical structure, and therefore influence their predictions. A crucial assumption is the host-vector interaction encapsulated in the disease-transmission term, and a key prediction is the basic reproduction number, R(0). We connect these two model elements by demonstrating how the choice of transmission term qualitatively and quantitatively alters R(0) and therefore alters predicted disease dynamics and control implications. Whereas some transmission terms predict that reducing the host population will reduce disease outbreaks, others predict that this will exacerbate infection risk. These conflicting predictions are reconciled by understanding that different transmission terms apply biologically only at certain population densities, outside which they can generate erroneous predictions. For West Nile virus, R(0) estimates for six common North American bird species indicate that all would be effective outbreak hosts.

T1  - Relating West Nile virus case fatality rates to demographic and surveillance variables
A1  - Tackett J.
A1  - Charnigo R.
A1  - Caldwell G. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Objective. The purpose of this ecological study was to relate West Nile virus (WNV) human case fatality rates to county-level demographic and surveillance variables, thereby characterizing the populations to which WNV poses the greatest threat. Methods. The authors acquired data on human, avian, and mosquito WNV infections for the 13 states in which there were 100 or more human cases during 2003. The data on avian and mosquito infections were converted into surveillance variables using empirical Bayes methodology. A preliminary logistic regression model was formulated to relate these surveillance variables and demographic variables to case fatality rates. The statistical technique of backward elimination was applied to obtain a final model in terms of the variables most useful for predicting case outcomes. Results. The probability of a fatal outcome depends on the poverty rate for the county in which the infected person lives (p=0.0283), the average temperature (p<0.0001), and surveillance variables reflecting the fractions of Culex pipiens and Culex restuans mosquitoes among infected mosquitoes (p=0.0079; p=0.0076). Conclusions. Effective WNV educational programs and control measures are vital, especially in poverty-stricken areas. A uniform protocol for disseminating county-level data could facilitate timely responses to WNV outbreaks and to emerging infectious diseases more generally. ©2006 Association of Schools of Public Health.

T1  - Factorial analysis of the epidemic and infectious processes of tuberculosis in children
A1  - Aksiutina L.P. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - The direction and strength of a relation and a correlation between the parameters of an epidemic process of tuberculous infection were estimated by correlation and regression analyses where r is the correlation coefficient verging to one. A high correlation was found between the risk for infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the quality of measures aimed at isolating the source of infection--a bacteria-isolating adult. The morbidity rates in children with tuberculosis depend on the quality of preventive measures to a greater extent.

N2  - The isolation and treatment of symptomatic individuals, coupled with the quarantining of individuals that have a high risk of having been infected, constitute two commonly used epidemic control measures. Although isolation is probably always a desirable public health measure, quarantine is more controversial. Mass quarantine can inflict significant social, psychological, and economic costs without resulting in the detection of many infected individuals. The authors use probabilistic models to determine the conditions under which quarantine is expected to be useful. Results demonstrate that the number of infections averted (per initially infected individual) through the use of quarantine is expected to be very low provided that isolation is effective, but it increases abruptly and at an accelerating rate as the effectiveness of isolation diminishes. When isolation is ineffective, the use of quarantine will be most beneficial when there is significant asymptomatic transmission and if the asymptomatic period is neither very long nor very short.

T1  - A survey to investigate movements off sheep and cattle farms in New Zealand, with reference to the potential transmission of foot-and-mouth disease
A1  - Sanson R.L. 
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - AIM: To quantify the numbers and extent of movements off sheep and cattle farms in New Zealand, in order to construct more realistic simulation models to investigate how infectious diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) might spread. METHOD(S): Farmers from 500 randomly selected farms, comprising 100 from each of the following sectors, viz beef, dairy, grazing/dairy heifer rearing, sheep, and mixed sheep and beef, were asked to fill in diaries in which they recorded the movements of all animals, products, people, vehicles and equipment coming on to or leaving their farms during two separate 3-week periods, representing relatively 'busy and 'quiet' times of the year with respect to livestock movements. Where possible, the destination of each movement was identified and geo-coded, to allow the distance travelled to be calculated. Each movement was then classified according to the risk of transfer of FMD virus (FMDV), should the disease have been present on the study farm at the time of the movement. The data were then analysed to establish movement frequencies and distributions of distances travelled, by the different pastoral livestock sectors. RESULT(S): Two hundred and seventeen farmers returned one or more diaries. One hundred and ninety-three farmers completed a Busy-period diary, recording a total of 12,052 movements off their farms, a crude average of 62.4 per 3-week period, or 2.97 per day. Of these, 4.0% involved the transport of livestock, equating to 0.12 livestock consignments per day. In contrast, 186 Quiet-period diaries were returned, recording a total of 10,885 movements off, representing a crude average of 58.5 during the 3-week period, or 2.78 per day. Of these, 2.1% involved livestock, equating to 0.06 livestock consignments per day. The mean and median distances travelled during the Busy periods were 30.9 km and 13.1 km, respectively (range 0-1,167 km). In comparison, the mean and median distances travelled during Quiet periods were 41.3 and 14 km, respectively (range 0.4-1,203 km). CONCLUSION(S): People, vehicles, livestock and other items can travel off pastoral livestock farms in New Zealand to other farms either directly or via saleyards over extensive distances. This has implications for the potential spread of infectious diseases such as FMD. Movement parameters intended for use in the InterSpread Plus inter-farm simulation model of FMD were established, which will facilitate the prediction of likely spread and efficacy of controls in the unlikely event of a real-life outbreak.

N2  - The objective of this study was to describe the spatial and temporal dynamics of the 1999 outbreak of acute clinical infectious bursal disease (IBD) in broiler chicken farms in Denmark. The analysis was performed using data from all broiler farms located in the Jutland peninsula and the island of Funen (168 municipalities). The Moran's index I, K-functions and scan statistics were used to describe the dynamics of the epidemic. In addition, spatially correlated survival analyses were performed and the posterior frailties were mapped to identify areas with high or low survival times. From January to October 1999, a total of 43 farms (81 flocks) out of a total of 299 farms (2970 flocks) in 110 municipalities were infected with IBD. The outbreak developed more or less simultaneously in two regions, one in the north and the other in the center of the study area. The space-time descriptive methods suggested that the cases were more likely to occur during a short period of time and over relatively short distances, indicating that local factors facilitated the spread of the virus. For instance, the highest risk, as estimated by the K-function, was within 20 km and 20 days. The risk of transmission peaked in July and remained high until the end of the study. The spatially correlated survival analysis identified municipalities with low survival times that roughly corresponded to the clusters found using scan statistics. The analysis for the full hierarchical structure of the dataset identified variation (i.e. clustering) at the farm and municipality levels. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Syndromic surveillance systems might serve as an early warning to detect outbreaks of infectious diseases and chemical poisoning, including those caused by deliberate release. In England and Wales, data from National Health Service (NHS) Direct, a national telephone health advice service, were used for surveillance of 10 syndromes commonly occurring in the community. OBJECTIVE(S): The objective of this study was to evaluate NHS Direct syndromic surveillance using the "Framework for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems for Early Detection of Outbreaks", published by CDC. METHOD(S): Quantitative and qualitative assessments were performed. Examination of daily data flow was used to determine the timeliness and data quality. Validity was determined by comparing NHS Direct surveillance with a well-established clinical-based surveillance system using a time series analysis. Semistructured interviews of main stakeholders were conducted to determine usefulness, flexibility, acceptability, portability, stability, and system costs. RESULT(S): NHS Direct syndromic surveillance has representative national coverage, provides near real-time recording and data analysis, and can potentially detect high-risk, large-scale events. Direct costs are low and variable costs are unpredictable. Flexibility depends on urgency of the need for change, and portability relies on the existence of infrastructure similar to NHS Direct. Statistically significant correlation exists between NHS Direct surveillance and a surveillance system based on the Royal College of General Practitioners data for influenza-like illness. CONCLUSION(S): The CDC framework is a useful tool to standardize the evaluation of syndromic surveillance. NHS Direct syndromic surveillance is timely, representative, useful, and acceptable with low marginal costs and borderline flexibility and portability. Cross-correlation time series modeling might represent an appropriate method in the evaluation of syndromic surveillance validity.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: Public health surveillance systems that monitor daily disease incidence provide valuable information about threats to public health and enable public health authorities to detect enteric outbreaks rapidly. This report describes the INtegrated Forecasts and EaRly eNteric Outbreak (INFERNO) detection system of algorithms for outbreak detection and forecasting. METHOD(S): INFERNO incorporates existing knowledge of infectious disease epidemiology into adaptive forecasts and uses the concept of an outbreak signature as a composite of disease epidemic curves. RESULT(S): Four main components comprise the system: 1) training, 2) warning and flagging, 3) signature forecasting, and 4) evaluation. The unifying goal of the system is to gain insight into the nature of temporal variations in the incidence of infection. Daily collected records are smoothed initially by using a loess-type smoother. Upon receipt of new data, the smoothing is updated; estimates are made of the first two derivatives of the smoothed curve, which are used for near-term forecasting. Recent data and near-term forecasts are used to compute a five level, color-coded warning index to quantify the level of concern. Warning algorithms are designed to balance false detection of an epidemic (Type I errors) with failure to correctly detect an epidemic (Type II errors). If the warning index signals a sufficiently high probability of an epidemic, the fitting of a gamma-based signature curve to the actual data produces a forecast of the possible size of the outbreak. CONCLUSION(S): Although the system is under development, its potential has been demonstrated through successful use of emergency department records associated with a substantial waterborne outbreak of cryptosporidiosis that occurred in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1993. Prospects for further development, including adjustment for seasonality and reporting delays, are also outlined.

T1  - Is MHC enough for understanding wildlife immunogenetics?
A1  - Acevedo-Whitehouse K.
A1  - Cunningham A.A. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Along with reproductive success and predation, infectious disease is a major demographic and evolutionary driver of natural populations. To understand the evolutionary impacts of disease, research has focussed on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a genetic region involved in antigen presentation. There is a pressing need for the broader research currently conducted on traditional vertebrate models to be transferred to wildlife. Incorporating such knowledge will enable a broader understanding of the levels at which natural selection can act on immunity. We propose two new approaches to wildlife immunogenetics and discuss the challenges of conducting such studies. At a time when novel pathogens are increasingly emerging in natural populations, these new approaches are integral to understanding disease dynamics and assessing epidemic risks. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Early detection and surveillance for biopreparedness and emerging infectious diseases
A1  - Veenema T.G.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Biological weapons and emerging infectious diseases pose a significant risk to public health. A timely response is needed to effectively treat and contain a potential infectious disease outbreak. Detection and surveillance of biological agents needs to be sensitive and specific to allow providers to quickly and accurately identify the disease process and begin the necessary response procedures. This article addresses the importance of early detection and surveillance of both intentional and unintentional biological events. Challenges of bioterrorism and the nursing role in response are discussed. Epidemiological considerations, such as route of transmission and personal protective equipment, are presented. An overview of the major surveillance systems, including advances in computer-based technology, is provided to help health care providers become aware of current surveillance systems and clinical decision support tools designed to help diminish the impact of biological threats. © 2006 Online Journal of Issues in Nursing.

T1  - The scaling laws of human travel
A1  - Brockmann D.
A1  - Hufnagel L.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - The dynamic spatial redistribution of individuals is a key driving force of various spatiotemporal phenomena on geographical scales. It can synchronize populations of interacting species, stabilize them, and diversify gene pools1-3. Human travel, for example, is responsible for the geographical spread of human infectious disease4-9. In the light of increasing international trade, intensified human mobility and the imminent threat of an influenza A epidemic10, the knowledge of dynamical and statistical properties of human travel is of fundamental importance. Despite its crucial role, a quantitative assessment of these properties on geographical scales remains elusive, and the assumption that humans disperse diffusively still prevails in models. Here we report on a solid and quantitative assessment of human travelling statistics by analysing the circulation of bank notes in the United States. Using a comprehensive data set of over a million individual displacements, we find that dispersal is anomalous in two ways. First, the distribution of travelling distances decays as a power law, indicating that trajectories of bank notes are reminiscent of scale-free random walks known as Levy flights. Second, the probability of remaining in a small, spatially confined region for a time T is dominated by algebraically long tails that attenuate the superdiffusive spread. We show that human travelling behaviour can be described mathematically on many spatiotemporal scales by a two-parameter continuous-time random walk model to a surprising accuracy, and conclude that human travel on geographical scales is an ambivalent and effectively superdiffusive process. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.

T1  - The modeling of global epidemics: Stochastic dynamics and predictability

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - The global spread of emergent diseases is inevitably entangled with the structure of the population flows among different geographical regions. The airline transportation network in particular shrinks the geographical space by reducing travel time between the world's most populated areas and defines the main channels along which emergent diseases will spread. In this paper, we investigate the role of the large-scale properties of the airline transportation network in determining the global propagation pattern of emerging diseases. We put forward a stochastic computational framework for the modeling of the global spreading of infectious diseases that takes advantage of the complete International Air Transport Association 2002 database complemented with census population data. The model is analyzed by using for the first time an information theory approach that allows the quantitative characterization of the heterogeneity level and the predictability of the spreading pattern in presence of stochastic fluctuations. In particular we are able to assess the reliability of numerical forecast with respect to the intrinsic stochastic nature of the disease transmission and travel flows. The epidemic pattern predictability is quantitatively determined and traced back to the occurrence of epidemic pathways defining a backbone of dominant connections for the disease spreading. The presented results provide a general computational framework for the analysis of containment policies and risk forecast of global epidemic outbreaks. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

T1  - Using expert opinion to identify risk factors important to infectious salmon-anemia (ISA) outbreaks on salmon farms in Maine, USA and New Brunswick, Canada

N2  - Thirty industry or regulatory professionals, with extensive experience in the local infectious salmon-anemia (ISA) epidemic, were queried on their opinions regarding the spread and impact of ISA in Maine, USA and New Brunswick, Canada. Subjective probability-estimation techniques were used to elicit likelihood ratios (LR) for risk factors of potential relevance to the epidemic. Experts were asked to answer questions based on their direct and local experience with ISA, rather than through knowledge gained from scientific references or experience in other regions. The results found the strongest independent predictors of ISA infection to include (1) a site's proximity to other farms with clinically infected fish, (2) a previous history of ISA on the site, (3) whether a site fallows for a month or more between year classes and (4) whether the site employs harvest vessels practicing full containment of blood and stun water. The strongest predictors of ISA severity included (1) stocking density, (2) the length of time between infection and removal of infected fish, (3) whether fish are moved between pens (after infection) and (4) a farm's sea-lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) status. Experts believed that transmission of ISA virus during the local epidemic was influenced by proximity (spatial and temporal) to activities resulting in large-scale shedding of virus into a shared water column, and that severity of infection corresponded more to infected-fish removal practices and certain husbandry decisions. Personnel and equipment biosecurity measures were not seen as strong predictors of either infection or severity in this analysis, though their perceived level of importance was greater among government than industry experts. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - An update of the role of the primordial reservoir in the biological cycle of the process of infection and contagion is made, using diseases of very frequent incidence at the present moment in the Mediterranean Area and the Iberian Peninsula. These diseases are, amongst others Severe and Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Rabies, Lyme disease, African Horse Sickness, Blue Tongue, African Swine Fever, Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever, Hantavirosis, and Avian Influenza. The zoonoses classification proposed by the WHO Control Center in Athens in 1994 for the Mediterranean Area, based on the type of reservoir, the importance of the process and the type of transmission, and not focusing on the etiological agent, is very positively valued. Finally, the problem of Avian Influenza and the real risk posed by aquatic migratory birds in the diffusion and contagion of the present Avian Influence epidemics is reviewed.

T1  - Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: Current perspectives
A1  - Kluytmans-VandenBergh M.F.Q.
A1  - Kluytmans J.A.J.W. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a worldwide problem, although its prevalence varies considerably among countries. The epidemiology of MRSA is now changing; infections are no longer confined to the hospital setting, but also appear in healthy community-dwelling individuals without established risk factors for the acquisition of MRSA. Reported prevalence rates of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) vary widely among studies - largely because of the different definitions employed and different settings in which the studies have been performed. At present, molecular epidemiological definitions, based on staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing and phylogenetic analyses of the MRSA isolates, are considered the most reliable means by which to distinguish between hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) and CA-MRSA. CA-MRSA has been isolated predominantly from skin and soft tissue infections, such as abscesses, cellulitis, folliculitis and impetigo. Although CA-MRSA infections are usually mild, they may also be severe, and can result in hospitalisation and even death. CA-MRSA strains differ from the major pandemic clones of MRSA that account for the majority of epidemic HA-MRSA strains. Differences are found in SCCmec types, bacterial growth rate, and the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes and toxin genes. Mathematical models have shown that CA-MRSA has a high potential to become endemic in the community, and this will impact significantly on the control of MRSA in the hospital setting. Well-designed, community-based studies with adequate risk factor analysis are required to further elucidate the epidemiology of CA-MRSA and to improve strategies to control MRSA in both the community and hospital settings. © 2006 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

T1  - Societal learning in epidemics: Intervention effectiveness during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore
A1  - Drake J.M.
A1  - Chew S.K.
A1  - Ma S. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Background. Rapid response to outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases is impeded by uncertain diagnoses and delayed communication. Understanding the effect of inefficient response is a potentially important contribution of epidemic theory. To develop this understanding we studied societal learning during emerging outbreaks wherein patient removal accelerates as information is gathered and disseminated. Methods and Findings. We developed an extension of a standard outbreak model, the simple stochastic epidemic, which accounts for societal learning. We obtained expressions for the expected outbreak size and the distribution of epidemic duration. We found that rapid learning noticeably affects the final outbreak size even when learning exhibits diminishing returns (relaxation). As an example, we estimated the learning rate for the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Singapore. Evidence for relaxation during the first eight weeks of the outbreak was inconclusive. We estimated that if societal learning had occurred at half the actual rate, the expected final size of the outbreak would have reached nearly 800 cases, more than three times the observed number of infections. By contrast, the expected outbreak size for societal learning twice as effective was 116 cases. Conclusion. These results show that the rate of societal learning can greatly affect the final size of disease outbreaks, justifying investment in early warning systems and attentiveness to disease outbreak by both government authorities and the public. We submit that the burden of emerging infections, including the risk of a global pandemic, could be efficiently reduced by improving procedures for rapid detection of outbreaks, alerting public health officials, and aggressively educating the public at the start of an outbreak. © 2006 Drake et al.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To describe knowledge, attitudes and behaviors on infectious diseases in different Chinese populations by their education levels, occupation and residential districts. METHOD(S): Data regarding awareness of the transmission routes and prevention strategies on hepatitis, sexually transmitted diseases (STD), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and prevalence rates on a) self-reported STD b) seeking treatment for STD c) source of knowledge on AIDS prevention, were calculated based on results from 17 questions of BRFS questionnaire by weight on age structures from 2000 census. RESULT(S): Most people realized that hepatitis, STD and AIDS were important issues in public health. However, their awareness on the transmission routes of these diseases was not satisfied. Moreover, due to the fear of these diseases, 27.6% and 30.1% of the people studied thought that shaking hands with STD patients and HIV carriers could get infected. 9.9% of the people reported that they ever used a condom during the past year. 2.2/1000 of the people reported that they had ever suffered from STD during the past 5 years, with 3.4/1000 in males, 0.9/1000 in females, 4.2/1000 in urban population and 1.6/1000 in rural population. Among these STD patients, 75.0% of them reported that they had ever received treatment in a STD clinic including 38.2% of them reporting that they had ever received treatment in private clinics without license, and 6.7% of them reported that they had ever treated by drugs bought by themselves. 47.0% of people reported that they had received health education materials or information on AIDS prevention from medical workers or through media. 12.1% of the people had been informed that condom use could prevent from STD and AIDS transmission. CONCLUSION(S): The awareness on hepatitis, STD and AIDS was quite insufficient in the Chinese general population, especially in rural and western part of China. With the development of AIDS epidemic from people with high risk behavior to the general population, China will undertake tremendous disease burdens from AIDS in the future.

T1  - Human influenza--recent outbreak of avian influenza A/H5N1 among human in Asian countries--
A1  - Suzuki H. 
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Since late 2003, avian influenza A/H5N1 virus has infected 100 adults and children in Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia resulting in 54 deaths (54.0%). The avian H5N1 is becoming more infectious for people and capable of human-to-human transmission. Experts have warned that the widespread occurrence of the H5N1 could ignite a pandemic capable of killing millions of people around the world. However, calculating with any precision the risk or when it will strike is impossible, and yet the consequences of failing to respond to this uncertain threat could be dire. At this stage, time-series epidemiological and virological analysis on the shift of avian to human influenza viruses are quite important for control of the H5N1 outbreak and the pandemic.

T1  - Effects of host density on furunculosis epidemics determined by the simple SIR model
A1  - Ogut H.
A1  - LaPatra S.E.
A1  - Reno P.W. 
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - To determine the transmission dynamics of furunculosis, Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha held at various densities were challenged with a single infectious fish. Data from the in vivo experiments were compared to predicted values from a susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model. Seven different densities were tested including 9.13, 4.56, 0.72, 0.36, 0.19, 0.06 and 0.03 fish/L and each produced different transmission coefficients (beta) of 0.01, 0.019, 0.0051, 0.0076, 0.0001, 0.0005 and 0.00, respectively. Furunculosis related mortality rates decreased as density of the host decreased. Mortality rates at the highest fish densities where disease specific mortality (DSM) was observed were 0.42, 0.44, 0.18 and 0.02 infected animals per day. The natural mortality rate also followed a similar pattern with 0.005, 0.005, 0.001, 0.005, 0.0001, 0.000 and 0.000 surviving animals per day. The results indicated that the transmission coefficient and the DSM of furunculosis was dependent on host density. It is possible that fish behavioral changes at the lower densities caused the reproductive rate of disease to be persistent even at very low densities. In summary, the simple SIR model suggested that low mortality does not always mean low prevalence of furunculosis in a given population. This is the first study evaluating host density as a risk factor for fish diseases using experimental furunculosis data. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T1  - Joint spatial analysis of gastrointestinal infectious diseases

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - A major obstacle in the spatial analysis of infectious disease surveillance data is the problem of under-reporting. This article investigates the possibility of inferring reporting rates through joint statistical modelling of several infectious diseases with different aetiologies. Once variation in under-reporting can be estimated, geographic risk patterns for infections associated with specific food vehicles may be discerned. We adopt the shared component model, proposed by Knorr-Held and Best for two chronic diseases and further extended by (Held L, Natario I, Fenton S, Rue H, Becker N. Towards joint disease mapping. Statistical Methods in Medical Research 2005b; 14: 61-82) for more than two chronic diseases to the infectious disease setting. Our goal is to estimate a shared component, common to all diseases, which may be interpreted as representing the spatial variation in reporting rates. Additional components are introduced to describe the real spatial variation of the different diseases. Of course, this interpretation is only allowed under specific assumptions, in particular, the geographical variation in under-reporting should be similar for the diseases considered. In addition, it is vital that the data do not contain large local outbreaks, so adjustment based on a time series method recently proposed by (Held L, Hohle M, Hofmann M. A statistical framework for the analysis of multivariate infectious disease surveillance data. Statistical Modelling 2005a; 5: 187-99) is made at a preliminary stage. We will illustrate our approach through the analysis of gastrointestinal diseases notification data obtained from the German infectious disease surveillance system, administered by the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin. © 2006 SAGE Publications.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A key challenge for modelling infectious disease dynamics is to understand the spatial spread of infection in real landscapes. This ideally requires a parallel record of spatial epidemic spread and a detailed map of susceptible host density along with relevant transport links and geographical features., RESULTS: Here we analyse the most detailed such data to date arising from the UK 2001 foot and mouth epidemic. We show that Euclidean distance between infectious and susceptible premises is a better predictor of transmission risk than shortest and quickest routes via road, except where major geographical features intervene., CONCLUSION: Thus, a simple spatial transmission kernel based on Euclidean distance suffices in most regions, probably reflecting the multiplicity of transmission routes during the epidemic.

N2  - Background. In June 1998, we investigated one of the largest foodborne outbreaks of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli gastroenteritis reported in the United States. Methods. We conducted cohort studies of 11 catered events to determine risk factors for illness. We used stool cultures, polymerase chain reaction, and serologic tests to determine the etiologic agent, and we conducted an environmental inspection to identify predisposing conditions and practices at the implicated establishment. Results. During 5-7 June, the implicated delicatessen catered 539 events attended by >16,000 people. Our epidemiological study of 11 events included a total of 612 attendees. By applying the median prevalence of illness (20%) among events with ill attendees to the total number of events with any ill attendees, we estimate that at least 3300 persons may have developed gastroenteritis during this outbreak. Multiple food items (potato salad, macaroni salad, egg salad, and watermelon) were associated with illness, all of which required extensive handling during preparation. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli serotypc O6:H16 producing heat-labile and heat-stable toxins was isolated from the stool specimens from 11 patients. Eight patients with positive stool culture results, 11 (58%) of 19 other symptomatic attendees, and 0 (0%) of 17 control subjects had elevated serum antibody titers to E coli O6 lipopolysaccharide. The delicatessen had inadequate hand-washing supplies, inadequate protection against back siphonage of wastewater in the potable water system, a poorly draining kitchen sink, and improper food storage and transportation practices. Conclusions. In the United States, where enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli is an emerging cause of foodborne disease, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli should be suspected in outbreaks of gastroenteritis when common bacterial or viral enteric pathogens are not identified. © 2005 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

T1  - Estimating vaccine efficacy from outbreak size household data in the presence of heterogeneous transmission probabilities
A1  - Davis X.M.
A1  - Waller L.A.
A1  - Haber M. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - We develop a Bayesian approach for estimating vaccine efficacy for susceptibility ( VE S ) and infectiousness ( VE I ) using outbreak size household data. Our method allows for heterogeneity in transmission probabilities due to factors that are related to individual' characteristics, such as age, in addition to vaccination status. It also allows for between-household heterogeneity in transmission probabilities due to random effects associated with households, such as genetic or environmental effects. Using age as a potential covariate causing heterogeneity in individual' transmission probabilities in households consisting of adults and children, we present the results of a simulation study designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators of VE S and VE I . We found that estimates of VE I have larger bias and variance compared to those of VE S . We also use the approach to compare two vaccination designs: one vaccinating both adults and children, the other only children. Simulations reveal that the design that vaccinates both adults and children provides better estimates of V E S . There is no obvious difference between the two designs in the performance of the estimates of V E I . In regard to random effects between households and the scenarios considered, models that do not account for between-households heterogeneity produce fairly robust estimates even when household-level random effects are present.

T1  - Floods and Tsunamis
A1  - Llewellyn M. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - The CDC provides the following review and summary of the health effects of tsunamis [46]:. Immediate health concerns: *After the rescue of survivors, the primary public health concerns are clean drinking water, food, shelter, and medical care for injuries.*Flood waters can pose health risks such as contaminated water and food supplies.*Loss of shelter leaves people vulnerable to insect exposure, heat, and other environmental hazards.*Most deaths associated with tsunamis are related to drownings, but traumatic injuries are also a primary concern. Injuries such as broken limbs and head injuries are caused by the physical impact of people being washed into debris, such as houses, trees, and other stationary items. As the water recedes, the strong suction of debris being pulled into large populated areas can further cause injuries and undermine buildings and services.*Medical care is critical in areas where little medical care exists. Secondary effects: *Natural disasters do not necessarily cause an increase in infectious disease outbreaks. However, contaminated water and food supplies and the lack of shelter and medical care may have a secondary effect of worsening illnesses that already exist in the affected region.*Decaying bodies create very little risk for major disease outbreaks.*The people most at risk are those who handle the bodies or prepare them for burial. Long-lasting effects: The effects of a disaster are long-lasting. In the months after a disaster, a greater need exists for financial and material assistance, including*Surveying and monitoring for infectious and water- or insect-transmitted diseases*Diverting medical supplies from nonaffected areas to meet the needs of the affected regions*Restoring normal primary health services, water systems, housing, and employment*Helping the community recover mentally and socially after the crisis has subsided. One sad and unusual statistic from the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster is that many more women than men were killed. Another sad fact is that the number of children killed was disproportionately high. The mental health needs of the victims must be addressed. Addressing these psychologic needs, De Jong and colleagues [47] wrote: "In Banda Aceh we found that most people have a strong desire to move forward and to rebuild their lives." The crew on the Mercy observed great resiliency and strength in the Acehnese people. Although most people exposed to a disaster do well and only have transient symptoms, some individuals develop psychiatric illnesses [48]. Post-traumatic stress disorder clearly increases in the disaster-affected areas. Table 7 provides a comparison of the consequences of various disasters, including floods and tsunamis. Earthquakes cause many injuries. The working rule of thumb is to calculate three injuries for every death. Floods and tsunamis, on the other hand, do not typically cause a large number of injuries compared with deaths. This observation of 25 years ago is still valid today. For the United States to have been part of the international humanitarian response to the 2004 tsunami disasters was an honor and a privilege. The cooperation and coordination that occurred, though it may not have been perfect, gives reason to be optimistic about the future, for the world is truly a much smaller place than it used to be and the future depends on communication and mutual respect. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background. Outbreaks of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection have been epidemiologically linked to fresh produce, but the bacterium has not been recovered from the food items implicated. In May 2003, a cluster of gastrointestinal illness and erythema nodosum was detected among schoolchildren who had eaten lunches prepared by the same institutional kitchen. Methods. We conducted a case-control study and trace-back, environmental, and laboratory investigations. Case patients had culture-confirmed Y. pseudotuberculosis O:1 infection, erythema nodosum, or reactive arthritis. Bacterial isolates from clinical and environmental samples were compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results. Of 7392 persons at risk, 111 (1.5%) met the case definition; 76 case patients and 172 healthy control subjects were enrolled in the case-control study. Only raw grated carrots were significantly associated with illness in a logistic-regression model (multivariable odds ratio, 5.7 [95% confidence interval, 1.7-19.5]); a dose response was found for increasing amount of consumption. Y. pseudotuberculosis O:1 isolates from 39 stool specimens and from 5 (42%) of 12 soil samples that contained carrot residue and were obtained from peeling and washing equipment at the production farm were indistinguishable by PFGE. Conclusions. Carrots contaminated early in the production process caused a large point-source outbreak. Our findings enable the development of evidence-based strategies to prevent outbreaks of this emerging foodborne pathogen. © 2006 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

N2  - Autoimmunity is characterized by the reaction of cells (autoreactive T lymphocytes) or products (autoantibodies) of the immune system against the organism's own antigens (autoantigens). It may be part of the physiological immune response ("natural autoimmunity") or pathologically induced, which may eventually lead to development of clinical abnormalities ("autoimmune diseases"). Many different autoimmune diseases can occur, but all are characterized by the inappropriate or excessive immune response against autoantigens, leading to chronic inflammation, tissue destruction, and/or dysfunction. To date, more than 60 diseases have a proven or strongly suspected autoimmune etiology. Generally, autoimmune diseases are perceived to be relatively uncommon. However, when all autoimmune diseases are combined, the estimated prevalence is high (3-5% of the general population), which underlines their importance to public health. Because of difficulties in diagnosis and in designing and standardizing epidemiological studies, limited data are available, and the prevalence may actually be underestimated. Nonetheless, there is epidemiological evidence of increasing prevalence of certain autoimmune diseases in highly industrialized countries, which cannot be attributed to better diagnosis alone. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that autoimmune mechanisms may play a role in many other diseases (atherosclerosis, for instance). Autoimmune diseases are multifactorial. Both intrinsic factors (e.g. genetics, hormones, age) and environmental factors (e.g. infections, diet, drugs, environmental chemicals) may contribute to the induction, development, and progression of autoimmune diseases. Environmental factors are believed to be a major factor responsible for their increased prevalence. Environmental factors operating in a genetically susceptible host may directly initiate, facilitate, or exacerbate the pathological immune process, induce mutations in genes coding for immunoregulatory factors, or modify immune tolerance or regulatory and immune effector pathways. Drug-induced autoimmune or autoimmune-like disorders and hypersensitivity are of major concern and often the reason for withdrawing drugs from the market or restricting their use. Systemic allergy is not well understood and is often considered idiosyncratic, but it may be of an allergic or autoimmune nature. We have learned much about the mechanisms of idiosyncratic autoimmune diseases by studying the autoimmune phenomena that result from exposure to therapeutics. In addition, there have been several "point source" outbreaks of autoimmune diseases due to environmental exposures to chemicals such as Spanish toxic oil and L-tryptophan that have advanced our knowledge substantially. There is now considerable epidemiological evidence pertaining to the association between occupational exposure to crystalline silica dust (quartz) and the risk of several systemic autoimmune diseases (specifically, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic small vessel vasculitis). Epidemiological studies also support a role of occupational exposure to solvents in the development of systemic sclerosis, but a clear consensus has not developed on the specific exposures or classes of chemicals involved and whether this association extends to other diseases. Some autoimmune diseases (e.g. Graves disease, rheumatoid arthritis) have been associated with tobacco use, particularly among current smokers, but only weak or no associations have been seen with other diseases. Additional experimental research examining the effects of these and other chemical and physical agents, using exposure routes relevant to the human experience in occupational settings or in environmental contamination, is needed to advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. In contrast to the available studies concerning silica, solvents, and smoking, there are relatively few epidemiological data pertaining to the effect of dioxins, pesticides, or heavy metals on the development or progression of autoimmune diseases. There is also some research on the influence of dietary factors on autoimmune diseases. This is a broad area that includes caloric intake, specific nutrients and foods, and dietary supplements. Coeliac disease is an example of an autoimmune disease with a clear dietary link in which an immunological response to specific proteins in wheat, barley, and rye produces autoantibodies directed against tissue transglutaminase, causing mucosal damage in the small intestine. It is highly likely that infection plays a role in many autoimmune disorders, although the infectious agent and mechanism by which it causes disease may differ from one disorder to another. Most hypotheses relating infection to autoimmunity have assumed that infection plays a direct causal role, although it may simply serve as a predisposing factor. Infectious agents may play a role due to sequence homology with endogenous proteins, resulting in "molecular mimicry", and also may act as "priming" agents due to non-specific/polyclonal stimulation of immune factors such as cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules. Hygienic status, resulting in a lack of infectious stimuli, may have an impact on autoimmunity. Chemical agents may play an important role in interacting with infections, an area that has been poorly studied. There exist a variety of methods to detect enhanced antibody formation and autoantibodies in humans and experimental animals following environmental exposure. In contrast, tests available for measuring the potential of chemicals or environmental factors to produce autoimmune disease or augment existing autoimmune disease are not readily available. A large number of animal models exist that have been used primarily to explore basic mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities for certain autoimmune diseases. Etiology in the various models is based on genetic predisposition, induction with specific antigens (mostly in combination with an adjuvant), or challenge with infectious agents. Chemical-induced autoimmune disease models are less common. In addition, autoimmunogenic and allergenic effects of compounds are usually not identified in routine toxicity studies, in part because outbred animals are used and relevant parameters are not studied. In addition, outliers are usually discarded from the experiment, whereas in fact outliers may indicate unexpected and idiosyncratic immune effects. A general strategy to assess the autoimmunogenic potential of chemicals is lacking. One promising approach is the popliteal lymph node assay. This represents a straightforward and robust animal test model that may be used to link direct lymphocyte node reactions to local application of potentially immunoactive chemicals. However, these assays may be predictive of the sensitizing potential, but not necessarily of the autoimmunogenic potential, of agents and do not represent a systemic route of exposure. The burden on health and heavy costs of autoimmune diseases highlight their importance with regard to risk assessment. Risk assessment of autoimmunity associated with chemical or physical agents should consider available epidemiological data, hazard identification and dose-response data derived from animal and human studies, data related to mode of action, and susceptibility factors. The risk assessment process may eventually help to calculate the cost of autoimmune disease associated with exposure to chemical and physical agents. Currently, the risk assessment for agents that are suspected of inducing or exacerbating autoimmunity or autoimmune diseases is hampered by the fact that appropriate information is not available, particularly validated animal models. Because of the individual- and population-level burden of autoimmune disease, risk assessment with respect to this group of diseases assumes special importance.

T1  - Occupational tuberculosis: A review of the literature and the local situation
A1  - Tam C.M.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Objective. To review the risks and control of occupation-related tuberculosis. Data sources. Statutory notification data, local tuberculosis programme data, and census data were reviewed. Literature search of PubMed was performed up to December 2005. Study selection. Original and major review articles related to tuberculosis among health care workers and guidelines for prevention were reviewed. Data extraction. Relevant data were extracted from our literature review and local sources. Data synthesis. Earlier experimental data demonstrated an airborne spread of tuberculosis and a steady state mathematical model for quantification of the transmission risk. In the post-chemotherapy era in developed countries, few studies demonstrated an occupational risk of tuberculin conversion outside of outbreak settings, and few studies were able to conclusively demonstrate an increased risk of active tuberculosis among health care workers. In countries with limited resource, the situation may be different, with a higher tuberculosis incidence among health care workers. Local tuberculosis programme and notification data from the Labour Department did not show an increased risk of active tuberculosis among health care workers. Although administrative control, engineering control, and personal protection are widely accepted control measures, it is difficult to quantify their cost-effectiveness. Conclusions. Although an increased liability to tuberculosis among health care workers is expected due to the concentration of infectious patients in their environment, prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment may minimise the risk. A high background rate of disease and possible healthy worker effect may make it difficult to pick up a small risk differential. With the ongoing threat of a nosocomial outbreak, continuing vigilance is called for.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly infectious, rapidly progressive, emerging disease. Early diagnosis and preventive measures are key for treatment and minimization of secondary spread. In the context of the armed forces, aggressive containment measures are essential to prevent an outbreak. In this study, we present the first reported case, to our knowledge, of SARS in a naval diver. The special physical requirements for divers and the potential complications associated with deep sea diving necessitate extensive investigation before certification of fitness for diving after SARS. In the early recovery period, potential problems during diving are caused by inadequate lung ventilation in relation to exercise level and increased breathing resistance attributable to weak respiratory muscles, with corresponding risk of hypoxia and hypercapnia, as well as decreased ability to respond to nonrespiratory problems during diving. Problems in the late recovery period include increased risk of diving complications (such as pulmonary barotrauma) resulting from fibrosis and scarring within the lung parenchyma, which are known complications of SARS. From our experience, we suggest that computed tomographic scans of the thorax, lung function tests, and careful follow-up monitoring should play a vital role in the assessment of patients during the convalescent period, before certification of fitness to dive.

N2  - A community-wide outbreak of legionnaires disease occurred in Pas-de-Calais, France, in November 2003-January 2004. Eighteen (21%) of 86 laboratory-confirmed cases were fatal. A case-control study identified smoking, silicosis, and spending >100 min outdoors daily as risk factors for acquiring the disease. Legionella pneumophila strain Lens was isolated from cooling towers, wastewater, and air samples from plant A. This unique strain matched all 23 clinical isolates, as assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis subtyping. Modeling of atmospheric dispersion of aerosols emitted from plant A cooling towers showed good coverage of the communes where patients lived and showed that the dispersion extended over a distance of at least 6 km from plant A. No other aerosol-producing installation was identified as a plausible source, and no common source of indoor exposure was found. These findings implicate plant A as the most likely outbreak source and suggest that the distance of airborne transmission of L. pneumophila may be greater than previously reported. © 2005 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

T1  - The impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on outcome and practice in trauma: Past, present and future
A1  - Grossman M.D.
A1  - Stawicki S.P. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Since the initial description of a concentrated outbreak of pneumocystis carnii pneumonia in 1981, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic has accounted for nearly 25 million deaths worldwide. This review focuses on estimations of prevalence by geographic region and identification of high-risk populations within each region, outcome for trauma patients with HIV and AIDS and risk management for health care workers who sustain occupational exposures. Trauma surgeons are more likely to encounter patients infected with HIV in geographic areas where HIV prevalence is high or in areas where intravenous drug use, high-risk sexual behaviours and penetrating trauma are more common. Patients with HIV may be expected to have higher rates of infectious and respiratory complications if they have active AIDS and/or liver disease caused by one of the hepatitis viruses. Certain aspects of therapy may change in this group of patients. Clinicians should be aware that highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) might produce complications. Occupational exposure among healthcare workers is uncommon. Cases of infection in healthcare workers from needlesticks are rare. Certain precautions regarding body fluid and needlestick exposures have been widely adopted over the past decade. When percutaneous injury results in known exposure to HIV, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) should be used and can be expected to be effective in preventing infection in the large majority of cases. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - In our article, "HIV-1 Epidemics Driven by Late Stage Disease," we conclude that the probability of transmission of HIV through promiscuous or casual sexual contacts is significantly higher in the third or symptomatic stage of the disease. Our results differ greatly from those of the current literature. The primary stage or first stage has been reported to be the most infectious based on an article by Jacquez et al. More recently, the Wawer et al study of monogamous heterosexual couples in Rakai, Uganda found that the transmission of HIV was most likely to occur in the first 5 months after infection. We describe how the findings of the Wawer et al study might be compatible with our results. We also respond to a response by Koopman and Simon, who seem to criticize their own paper severely and choose not to defend it against our remarks. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

T1  - Global climate changes, natural disasters, and travel health risks
A1  - Diaz J.H. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Whether the result of cyclical atmospheric changes, anthropogenic activities, or combinations of both, authorities now agree that the earth is warming from a variety of climatic effects, including the cascading effects of greenhouse gas emissions to support human activities. To date, most reports of the public health outcomes of global warming have been anecdotal and retrospective in design and have focused on heat stroke deaths following heat waves, drowning deaths in floods and tsunamis, and mosquito-borne infectious disease outbreaks following tropical storms and cyclones. Accurate predictions of the true public health outcomes of global climate change are confounded by several effect modifiers including human acclimatization and adaptation, the contributions of natural climatic changes, and many conflicting atmospheric models of climate change. Nevertheless, temporal relationships between environmental factors and human health outcomes have been identified and may be used as criteria to judge the causality of associations between the human health outcomes of climate changes and climate-driven natural disasters. Travel medicine physicians are obligated to educate their patients about the known public health outcomes of climate changes, about the disease and injury risk factors their patients may face from climate-spawned natural disasters, and about the best preventive measures to reduce infectious diseases and injuries following natural disasters throughout the world. © 2006 International Society of Travel Medicine.

T1  - Evolving public perceptions and stability in vaccine uptake
A1  - Reluga T.C.
A1  - Bauch C.T.
A1  - Galvani A.P. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Recent vaccine scares and sudden spikes in vaccine demand remind us that the effectiveness of mass vaccination programs is governed by the public perception of vaccination. Previous work has shown that the tendency of individuals to optimize self-interest can lead to vaccination levels that are suboptimal for a community. We use game theory to relate population-level demand for vaccines to decision-making by individuals with varied beliefs about the costs of infection and vaccination. In contrast to previous work proposing that universal vaccination is impossible in a game theoretic context, we show that optimal individual behavior can vary between universal vaccination and no vaccination, depending on the relative costs and benefits to individuals. By coupling game models and epidemic models, we demonstrate that the pursuit of self-interest often leads to stable dynamics but can lead to oscillations in vaccine uptake over time. The instability is exacerbated in populations that are more homogeneous with respect to their perceptions of vaccine and infection risks. This research illustrates the importance of applying temporal models to an inherently temporal situation, namely, the time evolution of vaccine coverage in an informed population with a voluntary vaccination policy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - A semi-stochastic model for Salmonella infection in a multi-group herd

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - A multi-group semi-stochastic model is formulated to identify possible causes of why different strains of Salmonella develop so much variation in their infection dynamics in UK dairy herds. The model includes demography (managed populations) and various types of transmission: direct, pseudovertical and indirect (via free-living infectious units in the environment). The effects of herd size and epidemiological parameters on mean prevalence of infection and mean time until fade out are investigated. Numerical simulation shows that higher pathogen-induced mortality, shorter infectious period, more persistent immune response and more rapid removal of faeces result in a lower mean prevalence of infection, a shorter mean time until fade out, and a greater probability of fade out of infection within 600 days. Combining these results and those for the deterministic counterpart could explain differences in observed epidemiological patterns and help to identify the factors inducing the decline in reported cases of epidemic strains such as DT104 in cattle. We further investigate the effect of group structure on the probability of a major outbreak by using the stochastic threshold theory in homogeneous populations and that in heterogeneous populations. Numerical studies suggest that group structure makes major outbreaks less likely than would be the case in a homogeneous population with the same basic reproduction number. Moreover, some control strategies are suggested by investigating the effect of epidemiological parameters on the probability of an epidemic. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - The association between the risk of childhood leukaemia before age 7 years and population-mixing at the place of residence at birth was investigated by retrospectively considering all the children born in mainland French communes between 1st January 1990 and 31st December 1998. An increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was found with higher levels of migration for children residing at birth in isolated communes with a population density {greater than or slanted equal to}50 people per km2 (SIRR = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.48-4.49). No association was observed with lower population densities. For children residing in non-isolated communes at birth, the results were similar but less marked. The risk tended to increase only for population densities {greater than or slanted equal to}5000 people per km2 (SIRR = 1.57, 95% CI: 0.99-2.52). The findings are consistent with epidemic models and support the hypothesis of an infectious aetiology relating to population-mixing. Population density may be seen as an indicator of the opportunity of contacts between inhabitants and should therefore be taken into account when investigating an infectious hypothesis. This is the first systematic study of population-mixing at the place of residence at the time of birth to be conducted on a national scale. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - A model of the relationship between the epidemiology of Johne's disease and the environment in suckler-beef herds

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - A non-predictive, dynamic and stochastic herd-level simulation model of an outbreak of Johne's in a suckler-beef herd is reported. Importantly, the model incorporates, with a simple method, the environment as the primary source of infection, reflecting the consensual understanding of the disease. The model also takes into account the density of the infectious agent in the environment. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the model is highly and equally sensitive to certain parameters (probability of infection in the presence of one unit of bacterial density, infectious area and bacterial shedding rate). Mathematical reasons for this similarity in sensitivity are presented. Compared to many other diseases, data for Johne's are scarce. Therefore models of Johne's outbreaks including this one cannot be predictive or easily validated. The qualitative results: (a) demonstrate the modelled effect of inclusion of infection via the environment; (b) suggest management factors that could be tested by experimentation or observation. Estimates for the rate of transmission, arising from the model output, are similar to published empirical estimates. The results of future empirical research should aid scientific understanding of the disease, help validate this model and might bring economic benefits through improved management. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Predicting epidemics on directed contact networks

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Contact network epidemiology is an approach to modeling the spread of infectious diseases that explicitly considers patterns of person-to-person contacts within a community. Contacts can be asymmetric, with a person more likely to infect one of their contacts than to become infected by that contact. This is true for some sexually transmitted diseases that are more easily caught by women than men during heterosexual encounters; and for severe infectious diseases that cause an average person to seek medical attention and thereby potentially infect health care workers (HCWs) who would not, in turn, have an opportunity to infect that average person. Here we use methods from percolation theory to develop a mathematical framework for predicting disease transmission through semi-directed contact networks in which some contacts are undirected-the probability of transmission is symmetric between individuals-and others are directed-transmission is possible only in one direction. We find that the probability of an epidemic and the expected fraction of a population infected during an epidemic can be different in semi-directed networks, in contrast to the routine assumption that these two quantities are equal. We furthermore demonstrate that these methods more accurately predict the vulnerability of HCWs and the efficacy of various hospital-based containment strategies during outbreaks of severe respiratory diseases. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Controlling an emerging communicable disease requires prompt adoption of measures such as quarantine. Assessment of the efficacy of these measures must be rapid as well. In this paper, the authors present a framework to monitor the efficacy of control measures in real time. Bayesian estimation of the reproduction number R (mean number of cases generated by a single infectious person) during an outbreak allows them to judge rapidly whether the epidemic is under control (R < 1). Only counts and time of onset of symptoms, plus tracing information from a subset of cases, are required. Markov chain Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo sampling are used to infer the temporal pattern of R up to the last observation. The operating characteristics of the method are investigated in a simulation study of severe acute respiratory syndrome-like outbreaks. In this particular setting, control measures lacking efficacy (R >= 1.1) could be detected after 2 weeks in at least 70% of the epidemics, with less than a 5% probability of a wrong conclusion. When control measures are efficacious (R = 0.5), this situation may be evidenced in 68% of the epidemics after 2 weeks and 92% of the epidemics after 3 weeks, with less than a 5% probability of a wrong conclusion.

N2  - The clinical spectrum of Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) ranges from diarrhoea to severe life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis. Although not always associated with previous antibiotic exposure, it is in the majority of cases. CDAD is recognised increasingly in a variety of animal species and in individuals previously not considered to be predisposed. C. difficile can be transmitted via personal contact or environmentally. The role of patients and healthcare workers who are symptom-free but colonised with C.difficile in the intestinal tract is unclear. C.difficile, with more than 150 PCR ribotypes and 24 toxinotypes, has a pathogenicity locus (PaLoc) with genes encoding enterotoxin A (tcdA) and cytotoxin B (tcdB). Genes for the binary toxin are located outside the PaLoc, but the role of this toxin is unclear. The recently completed genome sequence of C.difficile 630 revealed a large proportion of 11% of mobile genetic elements, mainly in the form of conjugative transposons. Diagnostic assays include tests for the detection of C.difficile products or genes and culture methods for isolation of a toxin-producing bacterium. Enzyme immunoassays to detect toxin in faeces are widely available, with varying sensitivities and specificities. Despite practical drawbacks and sensitivity less than 100%, the cell cytototoxicity assay is still considered to be the standard. Rapid diagnostic assays are available on a limited scale and require much improvement. Molecular tests enable the detection of carriers of toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains, as does culture. It is highly recommended to culture C.difficile from toxin-positive faeces samples and to store isolates for future characterisation and typing. The financial impact of CDAD on the healthcare system is substantial (5-15000/case in England and $1.1billion/year in the USA). Assuming a European Union population of 457 million, the potential cost of CDAD can be estimated to be 3000million/year, and is expected to almost double over the next four decades. In North America, increasing rates of CDAD have been reported in Canada and the USA since March 2003, involving a more severe course, higher mortality, increased risk of relapse and more complications. This increased virulence is presumably associated with higher levels of toxin production by fluoroquinolone-resistant strains belonging to PCR ribotype 027, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) type NAP1, REA (restriction endonuclease analysis) type BI and toxinotype III. In Europe, outbreaks of CDAD due to the new, highly virulent strain of C.difficile PCR ribotype 027, toxinotype III have been recognised in 75 hospitals in England, 16 hospitals in The Netherlands, 13 healthcare facilities in Belgium and nine healthcare facilities in France. These outbreaks are very difficult to control, and preliminary results from case-control studies indicate a correlation with fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins. Information concerning community-acquired cases of ribotype 027 is lacking, and data concerning its incidence in nursing homes are limited. European countries should first develop early-warning and response capabilities at a national level. Depending on the nature of the notifications received, countries should implement laboratory-based or patient-based surveillance systems in specific, targeted populations. © 2006 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

N2  - Surprisingly little is known regarding the human mixing patterns relevant to the spread of close-contact infections, such as measles, influenza and meningococcal disease. This study aims to estimate the number of partnerships that individuals make, their stability and the degree to which mixing is assortative with respect to age. We defined four levels of putative at-risk events from casual (physical contact without conversation) to intimate (contact of a sexual nature), and asked university student volunteers to record details on those they contacted at these levels on three separate days. We found that intimate contacts are stable over short time periods whereas there was no evidence of repeat casual contacts with the same individuals. The contacts were increasingly assortative as intimacy increased. Such information will aid the development and parameterisation of models of close contact diseases, and may have direct use in outbreak investigations. © 2006 Edmunds et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

T1  - The initial hospital response to an epidemic

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - The last decades have been characterized by the appearance of a substantial number of newly recognized or novel infectious agents and by the re-emergence of infectious diseases with a global impact. The objective of this article is to briefly describe the model of hospital response for early diagnosis and prompt management of patients with highly contagious infectious diseases. We reviewed the main components of hospital preparedness in response to clustering of highly contagious diseases. A model for the initial hospital response to an epidemic in our referral Institute is discussed. Prompt recognition and identification is the initial and indispensable step in facing any communicable diseases, regardless of whether it is a prevalent, a newly emerging one or deliberately released. The importance of developing and implementing nontraditional methods of public health surveillance and a system that allows a wide and immediate dissemination of information and exchange of views on risk assessment and risk management are highlighted. Case identification and laboratory capabilities and isolation procedures are the essential components for an initial hospital response. The recent bioterrorist events and the worldwide outbreaks of highly contagious infectious diseases have evidenced the need for institutional preparedness at each hospital and for identification of referral centers for patient isolation and of laboratories with adequate capabilities. Moreover, hospitals should develop a plan for coordinating all hospital components to respond to critical situations deriving from the admission of patients with highly contagious infectious diseases. © 2005 IMSS.

N2  - The setting of a quarantine time for an emerging infectious disease will depend on current knowledge concerning incubation times. Methods for the analysis of information on incubation times are investigated with a particular focus on inference regarding a possible maximum incubation time, after which an exposed individual would be known to be disease free. Data from the Hong Kong SARS epidemic are used for illustration. The incorporation of interval-censored data is considered and comparison is made with percentile estimation. Results suggest that a wide class of models for incubation times should be considered because the apparent informativeness of a likelihood depends on the choice and generalizability of a model. There will usually remain a probability of releasing from quarantine some infected individuals and the impact of early release will depend on the size of the epidemic.

N2  - We made a retrospective cohort study of a primary bloodstream infection outbreak in patients of a cancer unit in a general hospital, evaluated the impact of intervention measures and investigated the predisposing factors. The targeted predisposing factors were selected based on the medical literature. The data were treated with univariate analysis to calculate the relative risk, and statistical significance was set at p<0.05. The presence of a long-term totally-implanted central venous catheter appears to be a predisposing factor, while a peripheral venous catheter appears to have offered protection from infection. This is reinforced by fact that intervention measures controlled the outbreak, suggesting cross-contamination from a common source. These findings corroborate the fundamental role of the hospital infection control service in early intervention and reinforce the need for continued training of health professionals that perform this type of care. © 2005 by The Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases and Contexto Publishing.

N2  - Background. Since 2002, an epidemic of Clostridium difficile-associated- diarrhea (CDAD) associated with a high case-fatality rate has involved >30 hospitals in the province of Quebec, Canada. In 2003, a total of 55% of patients with CDAD at our hospital had received fluoroquinolones in the preceding 2 months. It has been suggested that massive use of proton pump inhibitors might have facilitated this epidemic. Methods. To delineate the risk of CDAD associated with specific classes of antibiotics and whether this is modulated by concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors and other drugs altering gastric acidity or gastrointestinal motility, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized in a teaching hospital in Sherbrooke, Canada, during the period of January 2003 through June 2004. We obtained data on 7421 episodes of care corresponding to 5619 individuals. Patients were observed until they either developed CDAD or died or for 60 days after discharge from the hospital. Adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) were calculated using Cox regression. Results. CDAD occurred in 293 patients. Fluoroquinolones were the antibiotics most strongly associated with CDAD (AHR, 3.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.65-4.47). Almost one-fourth of all inpatients received quinolones, for which the population-attributable fraction of CDAD was 35.9%. All 3 generations of cephalosporins, macrolides, clindamycin, and intravenous beta-lactam/beta- lactamase inhibitors were intermediate-risk antibiotics, with similar AHRs (1.56-1.89). Proton pump inhibitors (AHR, 1.00, 95% CI, 0.79-1.28) were not associated with CDAD. Conclusions. Administration of fluoroquinolones emerged as the most important risk factor for CDAD in Quebec during an epidemic caused by a hypervirulent strain of C. difficile. © 2005 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

T1  - The prevention and control of human leptospirosis
A1  - John T.J. 
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Human leptospirosis is prevalent in several states in India, sporadically or as outbreaks, especially during rainy seasons. It affects predominantly male adults who work in agriculture, causing severe morbidity and unnecessary mortality. Yet, there is no systematic leptospirosis prevention and control programme in the country, as it is not identified as priority under the national health policy. Therefore states with leptospirosis ought to establish public health programme for its prevention and control, as part of building a comprehensive initiative for the control of all-important infectious diseases. After establishing disease surveillance and laboratory support service, the disease burden must be monitored before and during interventions for control. The District is the ideal unit of activity, with full participation of the State Government and Local Panchayati raj. The public health staff must give technical leadership and the risk factors of human leptospirosis must be identified and specific interventions targeted against them. Action must be local-area-specific and coordinated between the Departments of Health, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Environment and Forestry. A model leptospirosis control programme has been formulated in Kerala State and is awaiting implementation. A state level Diagnostic and Epidemiolgy centre has been established to provide technical leadership. This model must be implemented and also replicated in other states. The most important ingredient for the control of infectious diseases is the 'political will'.

T1  - Systemic hypertension: An endemic, epidemic, and a pandemic
A1  - Lackland D.T. 
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Disease epidemics have influenced world history throughout time. Although disease patterns such as the plague and smallpox historically have been infectious in nature, chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, and end-stage renal disease have become the new global epidemics. The effects of these conditions affect nearly all populations of the world. Although high blood pressure has been implicated as the common link of these pandemic patterns only for less than half a century, the impact of hypertension treatment and control has become a documented population-based response with the greatest potential for global impact. For example, an estimated 45% of the deaths among African-American men could be prevented with treatment of high blood pressure to goal level. However, population demographics and risk factors predict a worsening effect as the populations of the world increase in age, racial disparities in access to medical care widen, and comorbid conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome continue to increase at epidemic rates. The economic impact of hypertension-related conditions, end-stage renal disease, and congestive heart failure is staggering, such that health care delivery systems will fail if the current trends are not changed. Hospitalization rates of hypertension-related conditions are increasing along with an aging population. The number of at-risk individuals in the population also is increasing. As the definition of hypertension changes with lower levels of blood pressure, the proportion of the population considered to have hypertension increases substantially. These trends and disease patterns clearly identify the essential need to implement population and clinical strategies for high blood pressure prevention, treatment, and control. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

T3  - Le nouveau variant de la maladie de Creutzfeldt-Jakob en France: Estimation du nombre de cas attribuables a un sejour dans les iles britanniques entre 1980 et 1995

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Background: The outbreak of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) cases rose serious concerns about secondary transmission of the disease, particularly through blood transfusion. Protective measures leading to the exclusion of potentially infectious blood donors were settled: in France, donors who had stayed more than one year in the UK were excluded. In this work, which was part of a larger study aiming to estimate the French epidemic of vCJD, the number of vCJD cases who were infected during a trip to the UK was estimated. Those estimates may notably enable the assessment of such exclusion measures. Method(s): The particular age-related structure in vCJD cases is taken into account in our simulations considering birth cohorts in the population. The total French exposure is simulated assuming the main source of infection to be dietary through consumption of mechanically recovered meat (MRM) manufactured from British bovine carcasses. Then, using a "back calculation" algorithm, all infected individuals required to produce a consistent epidemic (6 vCJD cases in 2003) was simulated. This study was exclusively focused on the part of the exposure linked to trips (beef MRM consumed in the UK while traveling) and on cases resulting from this exposure. Result(s): The influence of exposure linked to trips to the UK was greater in the youngest cohort (6.3% of the total exposure) while it only accounted for 3.3% and 1% in the 1939-69 and in the pre-1939 birth cohorts respectively. Overall, exposure resulting from trips in the UK can be neglected with regards to the exposure linked to the consumption of MRM produced in France from British bovine carcasses. Consequently, French vCJD cases that would have been infected in the UK are very unlikely to occur (median: 0 case, IC 95%: (0-2)). Nevertheless, if such cases occur, they would probably occur in subjects born after 1969 and their onset would take place before 2010. Thus, unlike the situation in BSE- free countries, the causal relationship between travel in the UK and occurrence of vCJD cases cannot be underlined in France, as trips only account for a small part of the French exposure. Conclusion(s): Since trips in the UK slightly contribute to the overall French exposure, excluding people who travelled in the UK from blood donation would not influence the risk of secondary transmission. © Masson, 2005.

N2  - Screening of potential MRSA-positive patients at hospital admission is recommended in German and international guidelines. This policy has been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency of nosocomial MRSA transmissions in the event of an outbreak, but the influence of screening on reducing hospital-acquired MRSA infections in a hospital setting where MRSA is endemic is not yet well-documented. This study describes the effect of hospital-wide screening of defined risk groups in a 700-bed acute care hospital during a period of 19 months. In a cohort study with a 19-month control period, the frequencies of hospital-acquired MRSA infections were compared with and without screening. In the control period, there were 119 MRSA-positive patients, of whom 48 had a hospital-acquired MRSA infection. On the basis of this frequency, a predicted total of 73.2 hospital-acquired MRSA infections was calculated for the screening period, but only 52% of the expected number (38 hospital-acquired MRSA infections) were observed, i.e., 48% of the predicted number of hospital-acquired MRSA infections were prevented by the screening programme. The screening programme was performed with minimal effort and can therefore be recommended as an effective measure to help prevent hospital-acquired MRSA infections. © 2005 Copyright by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

N2  - Background. We report the temporal-spatial spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) among inpatients in a hospital ward during a major nosocomial outbreak and discuss possible mechanisms for the outbreak. Methods. All inpatients who had stayed in the same ward as the initial index case patient for any duration before isolation were recruited into a cohort and followed up to document the occurrence of SARS. The normalized concentration of virus-laden aerosols at different locations of the ward was estimated by use of computational fluid dynamics modeling. The attack rates in the various subgroups stratified by bed location were calculated. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to document important risk factors. Results. The overall attack rate of SARS was 41% (30 of 74 subjects). It was 65%, 52%, and 18% in the same bay, adjacent bay, and distant bays, respectively (P = .001). Computation fluid dynamics modeling indicated that the normalized concentration of virus-laden aerosols was highest in the same bay and lowest in the distant bays. Cox regression indicated that staying in the ward on 6 or 10 March entailed higher risk, as well as staying in the same or adjacent bays. The epidemic curve showed 2 peaks, and stratified analyses by bed location suggested >1 generation of spread. Conclusions. The temporal-spatial spread of SARS in the ward was consistent with airborne transmission, as modeled by use of computational fluid dynamics. Infected health care workers likely acted as secondary sources in the latter phase of the outbreak. © 2005 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

T1  - Evaluation of surveillance and sample collection methods to document freedom from infectious bovine rhinotracheitis in cattle populations

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Objectives - To assess the sensitivity of the current surveillance program used in Denmark for detecting outbreaks of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) at the herd level and to evaluate the impact of alternative sample collection strategies on the sensitivity of the system in an acceptable time frame. Sample population - Data from the Danish Central Husbandry Register on cattle of 24,355 and 25,233 beef herds and on 13,034 and 12,003 dairy herds in the years 2000 and 2001, respectively. Procedures - Surveillance programs were evaluated under current sample collection conditions and under 3 alternative scenarios by use of simulation modeling. Data from the current detection component of the surveillance system were used as input, taking into consideration the sensitivity and specificity of bulk-tank milk and serologic testing. Results - The current system identifies infected dairy herds within a 3-month period with desired accuracy largely because of the test characteristics and number of bulk-tank milk samples. The system is less likely to detect infected beef herds in a timely manner because surveillance in beef herds depends solely on serologic testing at the time of slaughter. The efficiency of surveillance in dairy cattle herds was not decreased substantially when the slaughter-surveillance component was omitted. Conclusions and clinical relevance - Geographically targeted sample collection during the high-risk season (winter) was predicted to increase the probability of rapid detection of IBR infection in cattle. This approach can be used for assessing other surveillance systems to determine the best strategies for detection of infected herds.

T1  - Disease ecology and the global emergence of zoonotic pathogens
A1  - Wilcox B.A.
A1  - Gubler D.J. 
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - The incidence and frequency of epidemic transmission of zoonotic diseases, both known and newly recognized, has increased dramatically in the past 30 years. It is thought that this dramatic disease emergence is primarily the result of the social, demographic, and environmental transformation that has occurred globally since World War II. However, the causal linkages have not been elucidated. Investigating emerging zoonotic pathogens as an ecological phenomenon can provide significant insights as to why some of these pathogens have jumped species and caused major epidemics in humans. A review of concepts and theory from biological ecology and of causal factors in disease emergence previously described suggests a general model of global zoonotic disease emergence. The model links demographic and societal factors to land use and land cover change whose associated ecological factors help explain disease emergence. The scale and magnitude of these changes are more significant than those associated with climate change, the effects of which are largely not yet understood. Unfortunately, the complex character and non-linear behavior of the human-natural systems in which host-pathogen systems are embedded makes specific incidences of disease emergence or epidemics inherently difficult to predict. Employing a complex systems analytical approach, however, may show how a few key ecological variables and system properties, including the adaptive capacity of institutions, explains the emergence of infectious diseases and how an integrated, multi-level approach to zoonotic disease control can reduce risk.

N2  - Recently, a large-scale outbreak investigation was held among customers of a supermarket in the Dutch town of Zeist after an employee was diagnosed with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. About 14,000 people had a tuberculin skin test and an additional 6,000 had a chest X-ray. About 400 positive skin tests and 8 cases of active tuberculosis have been reported so far. Investigation of contacts of infectious tuberculosis cases is an important tool in tuberculosis control in low-prevalence countries. It includes chest X-ray examination for active pulmonary tuberculosis after or instead of tuberculin skin testing, and identifying contacts with latent tuberculosis infection followed by preventive treatment. Investigation of household and other close contacts is highly effective. This may not be true for sporadic contacts who are likely to have a low risk of infection, such as in this investigation, where the prevalence of recent infections estimated from reported data is only 3%. The benefits of detecting these cases must be weighed against the costs of such large-scale operations and the probability of false-positive skin test results.

N2  - In the past few years many waterborne outbreaks related to Cryptosporidium have been described. Current methods for detection of Cryptosporidium in water for the most part rely on viability assays which are not informative concerning the infectivity of oocysts. However, for estimation of the risk of infection with Cryptosporidium this information is required. For environmental samples the oocyst counts are often low, and the oocysts have been exposed to unfavorable conditions. Therefore, determination of the infectivity of environmental oocysts requires an assay with a high level of sensitivity. We evaluated the applicability of in vitro cell culture immunofluorescence assays with HCT-8 and Caco-2 cells for determination of oocyst infectivity in naturally contaminated water samples. Cell culture assays were compared with other viability and infectivity assays. Experiments with Cryptosporidium oocysts from different sources revealed that there was considerable variability in infectivity, which was illustrated by variable 50% infective doses, which ranged from 40 to 614 oocysts, and the results indicated that not only relatively large numbers of fresh oocysts but also aged oocysts produced infection in cell cultures. Fifteen Dutch surface water samples were tested, and the cell culture immunofluorescence assays were not capable of determining the infectivity for the low numbers of naturally occurring Cryptosporidium oocysts present in the samples. A comparison with other viability assays, such as the vital dye exclusion assay, demonstrated that surrogate methods overestimate the number of infectious oocysts and therefore the risk of infection with Cryptosporidium. For accurate risk assessment, further improvement of the method for detection of Cryptosporidium in water is needed. Copyright © 2005, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

T1  - A probabilistic transmission dynamic model to assess indoor airborne infection risks

A1  - Liang H.-M. 
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - The purpose of this article is to quantify the public health risk associated with inhalation of indoor airborne infection based on a probabilistic transmission dynamic modeling approach. We used the Wells-Riley mathematical model to estimate (1) the CO2 exposure concentrations in indoor environments where cases of inhalation airborne infection occurred based on reported epidemiological data and epidemic curves for influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), (2) the basic reproductive number, R0 (i.e., expected number of secondary cases on the introduction of a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population) and its variability in a shared indoor airspace, and (3) the risk for infection in various scenarios of exposure in a susceptible population for a range of R0. We also employ a standard susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) structure to relate Wells-Riley model derived R0 to a transmission parameter to implicate the relationships between indoor carbon dioxide concentration and contact rate. We estimate that a single case of SARS will infect 2.6 secondary cases on average in a population from nosocomial transmission, whereas less than 1 secondary infection was generated per case among school children. We also obtained an estimate of the basic reproductive number for influenza in a commercial airliner: the median value is 10.4. We suggest that improving the building air cleaning rate to lower the critical rebreathed fraction of indoor air can decrease transmission rate. Here, we show that virulence of the organism factors, infectious quantum generation rates (quanta/s by an infected person), and host factors determine the risk for inhalation of indoor airborne infection. © 2005 Society for Risk Analysis.

N2  - Simulation studies using susceptible-infectious-recovered models were conducted to estimate individuals' risk of infection and time to infection in small-world and randomly mixing networks. Infection transmitted more rapidly but ultimately resulted in fewer infected individuals in the small-world, compared with the random, network. The ability of measures of network centrality to identify high-risk individuals was also assessed. "Centrality" describes an individual's position in a population; numerous parameters are available to assess this attribute. Here, the authors use the centrality measures degree (number of contacts), random-walk betweenness (a measure of the proportion of times an individual lies on the path between other individuals), shortest-path betweenness (the proportion of times an individual lies on the shortest path between other individuals), and farness (the sum of the number of steps between an individual and all other individuals). Each was associated with time to infection and risk of infection in the simulated outbreaks. In the networks examined, degree (which is the most readily measured) was at least as good as other network parameters in predicting risk of infection. Identification of more central individuals in populations may be used to inform surveillance and infection control strategies.

T1  - Washing our hands of the congenital cytomegalovirus disease epidemic
A1  - Cannon M.J.
A1  - Davis K.F. 
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Each year in the United States, an estimated 40,000 children are born with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, causing an estimated 400 deaths and leaving approximately 8000 children with permanent disabilities such as hearing or vision loss, or mental retardation. More children are affected by serious CMV-related disabilities than by several better-known childhood maladies, including Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, and spina bifida., DISCUSSION: Congenital CMV is a prime target for prevention not only because of its substantial disease burden but also because the biology and epidemiology of CMV suggest that there are ways to reduce viral transmission. Because exposure to the saliva or urine of young children is a major cause of CMV infection among pregnant women, it is likely that good personal hygiene, especially hand-washing, can reduce the risk of CMV acquisition. Experts agree that such measures are likely to be efficacious (i.e., they will work if consistently followed) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that physicians counsel pregnant women about preventing CMV acquisition through careful attention to hygiene. However, because of concerns about effectiveness (i.e., Will women consistently follow hygienic practices as the result of interventions?), the medical and public health communities appear reluctant to embrace primary CMV prevention via improved hygienic practices, and educational interventions are rare. Current data on the effectiveness of such measures in preventing CMV infection are promising, but limited. There is strong evidence, however, that educational interventions can prevent other infectious diseases with similar transmission modes, suggesting that effective interventions can also be found for CMV. Until a CMV vaccine becomes available, effective educational interventions are needed to inform women about congenital CMV prevention., SUMMARY: Perhaps no single cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United States currently provides greater opportunity for improved outcomes in more children than congenital CMV. Given the present state of knowledge, women deserve to be informed about how they can reduce their risk of CMV infection during pregnancy, and trials are needed to identify effective educational interventions.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - The Susceptible Infected and Recovery (SIR) Model proposed by Robert May in the UK is the basis of the present mathematical model building of infectious disease epidemics. Need for model building incorporating more social and other relevant factors has been recognized. An important example is the introduction of idea of the scale-free distribution of links among the people. More refined models by taking into account the nature of a pathogen, geo-sociological factors, lifestyles of the people, etc., have been developed. For example, Koopman proposed a model for prediction of epidemic expansion based on actual epidemiological data. Eubank proposed a model assessing the bio-terror attack using a model city where every day activity is going on. The present workshop, participated by experts from the US, the UK and Japan, is the first meeting of the proposed series of conference on this issue.

N2  - Infection Control Recommendations for Patients With Cystic Fibrosis: Microbiology, Important Pathogens, and Infection Control Practices to Prevent Patient-to-Patient Transmission updates, expands, and replaces the consensus statement, Microbiology and Infectious Disease in Cystic Fibrosis published in 1994. This consensus document presents background data and evidence-based recommendations for practices that are intended to decrease the risk of transmission of respiratory pathogens among CF patients from contaminated respiratory therapy equipment or the contaminated environment and thereby reduce the burden of respiratory illness. Included are recommendations applicable in the acute care hospital, ambulatory, home care, and selected non-healthcare settings. The target audience includes all healthcare workers who provide care to CF patients. Antimicrobial management is beyond the scope of this document. The following information set the stage for the development of this guideline: (a) Studies published since 1994 that further our understanding of the modes of transmission of pathogens and effective strategies to interrupt transmission among CF patients provide the data needed for evidence-based guidelines. (b) Improved microbiology methods provide more accurate detection and further definition of the epidemiology of pathogens in CF patients. (c) The publication of the HICPAC/CDC (Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee/ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals in 1996 defined standard precautions and recommended universal application to care for all patients at all times to prevent transmission of infectious agents that may not yet have been identified. (d) The previously published HICPAC/CDC guidelines for prevention of healthcare-associated infections have not included background information and recommendations for the specific circumstances of patients with CE Thus, specific guidelines for CF patients are needed. (e) The link between acquisition of pathogens and morbidity and mortality is well established. Prevention of acquisition of specific pathogens may further improve the mean survival of CF patients, which has increased to 33.4 years in 2001. A multidisciplinary committee consisting of healthcare professionals from the United States, Canada, and Europe with experience in CF care and healthcare epidemiology/infection control reviewed the relevant literature and developed evidence-based recommendations graded according to the published peer-reviewed supportive data. The participants chose to use the following CDC/HICPAC system for categorizing recommendations based on previous experience in crafting infection control guidelines beyond CF: Category IA. Strongly recommended for implementation and strongly supported by well-designed experimental, clinical, or epidemiologic studies. Category IB. Strongly recommended for implementation and supported by some experimental, clinical, or epidemiologic studies and a strong theoretical rationale. Category IC. Required for implementation, as mandated by federal and/or state regulation or standard. Category II. Suggested for implementation and supported by suggestive clinical or epidemiologic studies or a theoretical rationale. No recommendation; unresolved issue. Practices for which insufficient evidence or no consensus regarding efficacy exist. Category IA and IB recommendations are strongly recommended for implementation by all CF centers and considered to be "best practice." Implementation of Category II recommendations is advised by the committee, but individual centers may determine which Category II recommendations would be appropriate for their CF centers. This document integrates knowledge of microbiology laboratory methods, infection control principles, and epidemiology of respiratory pathogens in CF patients. Standardization of infection control practices across CF centers will provide safer environments for patients by reducing the risk of transmission of CF pathogens. In addition to infection control practices that are applicable to all CF patients at all times, specific infection control practices are recommended for inpatient. ambulatory, and non-healthcare settings, based on the types of activities and risks associated with the various settings. CF care teams as well as patients and their families must be well educated concerning the known risks and the effective preventive measures to ensure adherence to the evidence-based recommendations in this document. It will be beneficial for each CF center to evaluate the effectiveness of its infection control program to reduce transmission of pathogens and improve clinical outcomes. Collaboration between the CF care team and the CF center's infection control team will facilitate effective implementation that takes into consideration the psychosocial impact of these recommendations. This document was reviewed by the members of HIC-PAC, and the recommendations were found to be consistent with the principles of infection control that serve as the foundation of HICPAC/CDC guidelines for prevention of healthcare-associated infections. This guideline was formally endorsed by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America and the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology boards in 2002-2003. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards has endorsed the recommendations for susceptibility testing. Infection Control Principles CF pathogens are transmitted by the droplet and contact routes. Therefore, practices that contain respiratory secretions and prevent transmission of respiratory tract pathogens must be taught to patients and their families as well as to CF healthcare workers. Such practices must be followed with all CF patients and cannot be implemented according to the specific microbiology results of individual CF patients because microbiology methods are not 100% sensitive for the detection of CF pathogens. In addition to washing hands with an antimicrobial-containing soap and water, alcohol-based antiseptic hand rubs are now recommended when hands are not visibly soiled with blood or body fluids because of the improved efficacy of these products in removing microorganisms from the hands. Use of gowns, gloves, and masks follows the recommendations for standard, contact, and droplet precautions that have been developed by CDC/HICPAC2 to prevent healthcare-associated infections in all patients, ie, both CF and non-CF patients. Contact precautions plus standard precautions are recommended for all CF patients infected (or colonized) with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Burkholderia cepacia complex, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, or vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Recommendations for room placement, activities outside the hospital room, CF clinic logistics, and adjuvant measures to prevent infections are provided. No recommendation can be made for the routine wearing of masks by CF patients when leaving an inpatient room or when in the waiting room of a CF clinic. Specific practices for the use and care of respiratory therapy equipment recommended in this document are based on principles of disinfection and sterilization as well as findings from investigations of outbreaks of infections associated with contaminated respiratory therapy equipment. Cleaning devices, such as nebulizers, with removal of debris as soon as possible and before disinfection, and complete air drying are the critical steps in both healthcare and home settings. Microbiology, Molecular Typing, and Surveillance Because aggressive antimicrobial treatment of P. aeruginosa at initial acquistion may be associated with a delay in chronic infection and an improved clinical course, respiratory tract cultures should be obtained at least quarterly in CF patients with stable pulmonary status as well as at the time of pulmonary exacerbations. Specific recommendations are made for transport and processing of specimens, including the preferred selective media. Agar-based diffusion assays, eg, antibiotic-containing disks or E-tests, rather than automated commercial microbroth dilution systems are recommended for susceptibility testing of P. aeruginosa isolates. Molecular typing using appropriate methods, eg, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), rapid amplified polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR), and repetitive DNA sequence PCR (Rep-PCR), are recommended to assess strain relatedness of isolates from different patients when patient-to-patient transmission is suspected. Recommendations are made to develop surveillance in collaboration with the CF center's infection control team. S. aureus, including MRSA, P aeruginosa, and B. cepacia complex are always targeted, whereas Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are included when considered epidemiologically important, eg, patient-to-patient transmission or an outbreak is suspected. Surveillance includes calculation of incidence and prevalence rates and review of antimicrobial susceptibility summaries with trend analysis. Surveillance reports should be shared between the infection control and CF care teams at least annually to evaluate effectiveness of the center's infection control program. Selected B. cepacia complex isolates and nonfermenting gram-negative organisms for which species identification cannot be established after routine analysis should be submitted to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Burkholderia cepacia Research Laboratory and Repository for further study.

N2  - Objective: To explore issues of medical professionalism in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a new emerging health threat. Design(s): Qualitative interviews analysed with grounded theory methodology. Setting(s): University hospitals in Toronto, Canada, during the SARS outbreak in 2003. Participant(s): 14 staff physicians from divisions of infectious diseases, general internal medicine, and critical care medicine. Result(s): Of 14 attending physicians, four became ill during the outbreak. Participants described their experiences during the outbreak and highlighted several themes about values inherent to medical professionalism that arose during this crisis including the balance between care of patients and accepted personal risk, confidentiality, appropriate interactions between physicians and patients, ethical research conduct, and role modelling of professionalism for junior doctors. Conclusion(s): Despite concerns raised by professional societies about the erosion of professionalism, participants in this study amply demonstrated the necessary qualities during the recent healthcare crisis. However, there were several examples of strained professional behaviour witnessed by the participants and these examples highlight aspects of medical professionalism that medical educators and professional organisations should address in the future, including the balance between personal safety and duty of care.

T1  - Chronic Wasting Disease of Cervids
T2  - Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has recently emerged in North America as an important prion disease of captive and free-ranging cervids (species in the deer family). CWD is the only recognized transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) affecting free-ranging species. Three cervid species, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), white-tailed deer (0. virginianus), and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), are the only known natural hosts of CWD. Endemic CWD is well established in southern Wyoming and northern Colorado, and has been present in this 'core area' for two decades or more. Apparently CWD has also infected farmed cervids in numerous jurisdictions, and has probably been endemic in North America's farmed deer and elk for well over a decade. Several free-ranging foci distant to the Colorado-Wyoming core area have been discovered since 2000, and new or intensified surveillance may well identify even more foci of infection. Whether all of the identified captive and free-ranging foci are connected via a common original exposure source remains undetermined. Some of this recently observed 'spread' may be attributable to improved detection or natural movements of infected deer and elk, but more distant range extensions are more likely caused by movements of infected captive deer and elk in commerce, or by some yet unidentified exposure risk factor. Research on CWD over the last 5 years has resulted in a more complete understanding of its pathogenesis and epidemiology. CWD is infectious, transmitting horizontally from infected to susceptible cervids. Early accumulation of PrPCWD in alimentary tract-associated lymphoid tissues during incubation suggests agent shedding in feces or saliva as plausible transmission routes. Residual infectivity in contaminated environments also appears to be important in sustaining epidemics. Improved tests allow CWD to be reliably diagnosed long before clinical signs appear. Implications of CWD are not entirely clear at this time. Natural transmission to humans or traditional domestic livestock seems relatively unlikely, but the possibility still evokes public concerns; impacts on wildlife resources have not been determined. Consequently, where CWD is not known to occur surveillance programs and regulations that prevent or reduce the likelihood that CWD will be introduced into these jurisdictions should be encouraged. Where CWD is known to occur, affected jurisdictions are conducting surveillance to estimate and monitor trends in geographic distribution and prevalence, managing deer and elk populations in attempts to limit spread, and developing and evaluating techniques for further controlling and perhaps eradicating CWD. Programs for addressing the challenges of CWD management will require interagency cooperation, commitment of funds and personnel, and applied research. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is perhaps the most enigmatic of the naturally occurring prion diseases. Although recognized as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) since the late 1970s (Williams and Young 1980, 1982), interest in and concern about CWD has only recently emerged. CWD most closely resembles scrapie in sheep in most respects, but recent media and public reaction to CWD has been more reminiscent of that afforded to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) less than a decade ago. Yet, with the exception of transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME), CWD is the rarest of the known animal TSEs: fewer than 1,000 cases have been diagnosed worldwide, and all but two of these occurred in North America. CWD is unique among the TSEs in that it affects free-living species (Spraker et al. 1997; Miller et al. 2000). The three natural host species for CWD, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), white-tailed deer (O. virginianus), and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), are all in the family Cervidae and native to North America. Like scrapie, CWD is contagious: epidemics are self-sustaining in both captive and free-ranging cervid populations (Miller et al. 1998, 2000). The geographic extent of endemic CWD in free-ranging wildlife was initially thought to be quite limited and its natural rate of expansion slow; however, recent investigations have revealed that CWD has been inadvertently spread much more widely via market-driven movements of infected, farmed elk and deer. Both the ecological and economic consequences of CWD and its spread remain to be determined; moreover, public health implications remain a question of intense interest. Here, we review current understanding of CWD, its implications, and its management.

N2  - Although severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is highly infectious in clinical settings, SARS has not been well examined in household settings. The household and household member attack rates were calculated for 1,214 SARS case-patients and their household members, stratified by two phases of the epidemic. A case-control analysis identified risk factors for secondary infection. Secondary infection occurred in 14.9% (22.1% versus 11% in earlier and later phases) of all households and 8% (11.7% versus 5.9% in the earlier and later phases) of all household members. Healthcare workers' households were less likely to be affected. Risk factors from the multivariate analysis included at-home duration before hospitalization, hospital visitation to the SARS patient (and mask use during the visit), and frequency of close contact. SARS transmission at the household level was not negligible in Hong Kong. Transmission rates may be greatly reduced with precautionary measures taken by household members of SARS patients.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Objective. To test the hypothesis that individuals are more likely to receive a vaccination against influenza or pneumonia as the perceived disease threat increases. Data Sources. This study uses two different national datasets. Individual-level information about the vaccination rates of 38,768 elderly persons are from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 1993-1998. Information on the combined influenza and pneumonia state mortality rates are measured from the Compressed Mortality File. Study Design. Using both cross-sectional and state fixed-effects panel data estimators, we model an individual's probability of having an influenza or pneumococcal vaccination as a function of the lagged state mortality rate. Multiyear lags are specified in order to estimate the duration of the effect of disease mortality on individual vaccination behavior. Principal Findings. Results support our hypothesis that influenza vaccination behavior responds positively to disease mortality, even after a one-year lag. We further find that cross-sectional estimators used in previous work yield downward-biased estimates, although even for our preferred panel data models, the estimated effects are small. Conclusions. The findings indicate that behavioral demand responses can help to limit infectious disease epidemics, and suggest further research on how public awareness campaigns can mediate this disease threat responsiveness behavior.

N2  - We assess the effects of strain heterology (strains that are immunologically similar but not identical) on equine influenza in a vaccinated population. Using data relating to individual animals, for both homologous and heterologous vaccinees, we estimate distributions for the latent and infectious periods, quantify the risk of becoming infected in terms of the quantity of cross-reactive antibodies to a key surface protein of the virus (haemagglutinin) and estimate the probability of excreting virus (i.e. becoming infectious) given that infection has occurred. The data suggest that the infectious period, the risk of becoming infected (for a given vaccine-induced level of cross-reactive antibodies) and the probability of excreting virus are increased for heterologously vaccinated animals when compared with homologously vaccinated animals. The data are used to parameterize a modified susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered/resistant (SEIR) model, which shows that these relatively small differences combine to have a large effect at the population level, where populations of heterologous vaccinees face a significantly increased risk of an epidemic occurring.

N2  - We present a model of a control programme for a disease outbreak in a population of livestock holdings. Control is achieved by culling infectious holdings when they are discovered and by the pre-emptive culling of livestock on holdings deemed to be at enhanced risk of infection. Because the pre-emptive control programme cannot directly identify exposed holdings, its implementation will result in the removal of both infected and uninfected holdings. This leads to a fundamental trade-off: increased levels of control produce a greater reduction in transmission by removing more exposed holdings, but increase the number of uninfected holdings culled. We derive an expression for the total number of holdings culled during the course of an outbreak and demonstrate that there is an optimal control policy, which minimizes this loss. Using a metapopulation model to incorporate local clustering of infection, we examine a neighbourhood control programme in a locally spreading outbreak. We find that there is an optimal level of control, which increases with increasing basic reproduction ratio, R0; moreover, implementation of control may be optimal even when R0 < 1. The total loss to the population is relatively insensitive to the level of control as it increases beyond the optimal level, suggesting that over-control is a safer policy than under-control.

T1  - Modelling strategies for minimizing the impact of an imported exotic infection
A1  - Roberts M.G. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 demonstrated the need to determine control strategies for exotic infections. The prior determination of such strategies, and the use of mathematical models to assist this, is hampered by the obvious lack of data. We propose an integral equation model of Kermack-McKendrick type that may be used to compare strategies based on the isolation of infectious individuals. The model structures the incidence of infection according to the location of an infected individual at exposure, and requires knowledge of the infectivity kernel and the initial rate of exponential increase of cases. The model's use in the design of strategies to minimize the risk of SARS in a previously unexposed community is demonstrated. © 2004 The Royal Society.

T1  - Population-based interventions for reducing sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection
A1  - Sangani P.
A1  - Rutherford G.
A1  - Wilkinson D. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted infections (STI) are common in developing countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that in 1999, 340 million new cases of syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis occurred. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is also common in developing countries. UNAIDS estimates that over 95% of the 40 million people infected with HIV by December 1999 live in developing countries (UNAIDS 2003). The STI and HIV epidemics are interdependent. Similar behaviours, such as frequent unprotected intercourse with different partners, place people at high risk of both infections, and there is clear evidence that conventional STIs increase the likelihood of HIV transmission. Several studies have demonstrated a strong association between both ulcerative and non-ulcerative STIs and HIV infection (Cameron 1989, Laga 1993). There is biological evidence, too, that the presence of an STI increases shedding of HIV, and that STI treatment reduces HIV shedding (Cohen 1997, Robinson 1997). Therefore, STI control may have the potential to contribute substantially to HIV prevention. OBJECTIVE(S): To determine the impact of population-based STI interventions on the frequency of HIV infection, frequency of STIs and quality of STI management. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following electronic databases were searched for relevant randomised trials or reviews:1) MEDLINE for the years 1966 to 2003 using the search terms "sexually transmitted diseases" and "human immunodeficiency virus infection"2) The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness and the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, in the most recent issue of the Cochrane Library3) The specialist registry of trials maintained by the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group.4) EMBASE The abstracts of relevant conferences were searched, and reference lists of all review articles and primary studies were scanned. Finally, authors of included trials and other experts in the field were contacted as appropriate. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials in which the unit of randomisation is either a community or a treatment facility. Studies where individuals are randomised were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria to potential studies, with any disagreements resolved by discussion. Trials were examined for completeness of reporting. The methodological quality of each trial was assessed by the same two reviewers, with details recorded of randomisation method, blinding, use of intention-to-treat analysis and the number of patients lost to follow-up, using standard guidelines of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group. MAIN RESULTS: Five trials were included.Frequency of HIV infection: In Rakai, after 3 rounds of treatment of all community members for STIs, the rate ratio of incident HIV infection was 0.97 (95%CI 0.81 to 1.16), indicating no effect of the intervention. In Mwanza, the incidence of HIV infection in the intervention groups (strengthened syndromic management of STIs in primary care clinics) was 1.2% compared with 1.9% in the control groups (OR=0.58, 95% CI 0.42-0.70), corresponding to a 38% reduction (95%CI 15% to 55%) in HIV incidence in the intervention group. In the newest trial by Kamali et al, the rate ratio of behavioral intervention & STI management compared to control on HIV incidence was 1.00 (0.63-1.58, p=.98). These are consistent with Rakai data showing no effect of intervention.Frequency of STIs: In both Mwanza and Rakai, there was no significant reduction in gonorrhoea, chlamydia, urethritis, or reported STI symptoms among intervention communities. The prevalence ratio of syphilis between intervention and control groups in Rakai was 0.8 (95%CI 0.71-0.89), of trichmoniasis was 0.59 (0.38-0.91), and of bacterial vaginosis was 0.87 (0.74-1.02). In Mwanza, the prevalence of serologically diagnosed syphilis in the intervention community was 5% compared with 7% in the control community at the end of the trial (adjusted re7% in the control community at the end of the trial (adjusted relative risk 0.71 (95%CI 0.54-0.93). In Kamali et al, there was a significant decrease in gonorrhoea and active syphilis cases. Rate ratio for gonorrhoea was 0.29(0.12-0.71, p=0.016), active syphilis was 0.53(0.33-0.84,p=0.016). There was a trend towards significance with intervention on the use of condoms with the last casual partner; the rate ratio was 1.27(1.02-1.56,p=0.036).Quality of treatment: In Lima, following training of pharmacy assistants in STI syndromic management, symptoms were recognised as being due to an STI in 65% of standardised simulated patients (SSPs) visiting intervention and 60% of SSPs visiting control pharmacies (p=0.35). Medication was offered without referral to a doctor in most cases (83% intervention and 78% control, p=0.61). Of those SSPs offered medication, only 1.4% that visited intervention pharmacies and only 0.7% of those that visited control pharmacies (p=0.57) were offered a recommended regimen. Similarly in only 15% and 16% of SSP visits respectively was any recommended drug offered. However, education and counseling were more likely to be given to SSPs visiting intervention pharmacies (40% vs 27%, p=0.01). No SSPs were given partner cards or condoms. In Hlabisa, following the intervention targeting primary care clinic nurses (strengthened STI syndromic management and provision of STI syndrome packets containing recommended drugs, condom, partner cards and patient information leaflets), SSPs were more likely to be given recommended drugs in intervention clinics (83% vs 12%, p<0.005) and more likely to be correctly case managed [given correct drugs, partner cards and condoms] (88% vs 50%, p<0.005). There were no significant differences in the proportions adequately counseled (68% vs 46%, p=0.06), experiencing good staff attitude (84% vs 58%, p=0.07), and being consulted in privacy (92% vs 86%, p=0.4). There was no strong evidence of any impact on treatment-seeking behaviour, utilisation of services, or sexual behaviour in any of the four trials. REVIEWERS' CONCLUSION(S): There is limited evidence from randomised controlled trials for STI control as an effective HIV prevention strategy. Improved STI treatment services have been shown to reduce HIV incidence in an environment characterised by an emerging HIV epidemic (low and slowly rising prevalence), where STI treatment services are poor and where STIs are highly prevalent. There is no evidence for substantial benefit from treatment of all community members. The addition of the Kamali trial to the existing evidence supports the data from the Rakai trial of no effect. There are, however, other compelling reasons why STI treatment services should be strengthened, and the available evidence suggests that when an intervention is accepted it can substantially improve quality of services provided. The Kamali trial shows an increase in the use of condoms, a marker for improved risk behaviors. Further community-based randomised controlled trials that test a range of alternative STI control strategies are needed in a variety of different settings. Such trials should aim to measure a range of factors that include health seeking behaviour and quality of treatment, as well as HIV, STI and other biological endpoints.

T1  - A mathematical model of the effects of chronic carriers on the within-herd spread of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia in an African mixed crop-livestock system

N2  - Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a respiratory disease of cattle; CBPP is caused by Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides small colony. CBPP is a major cause for concern for African countries (because of mortality, animal-production losses and cost of control). The clinical form of the disease is the more infectious (contagion occurs essentially through coughing). However, chronic lung lesions with viable mycoplasmas can persist in recovering cattle. Animals presenting these lesions might have a time-delimitated infectious phase. Such carriers are suspected to generate field outbreaks (although this hypothesis remains debated). We investigated the potential quantitative effects of these chronic carriers on the within-herd CBPP spread. Data were collected during a longitudinal field herd survey in a mixed crop-livestock system in the Ethiopian highlands. Two stochastic Markov-chain models' outputs (seroconversion dynamics, basic reproduction ratio R0, cumulative clinical incidence and risk of herd infection) were compared given different hypotheses on the carrier infectiousness. The late seroconversions observed in the field data were fitted correctly only for the highest carrier infectiousness we considered (mean chronic duration of 1 year and carriers 50-times less infectious than clinical cases). Although sensitivities (in terms of disease impact in the herd) were in general negligible when the carrier infectiousness was low (e.g. when carriers were assumed to be 1000-times less infectious than clinical cases), they rapidly became important when the infectiousness increased. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - A branching model for the spread of infectious animal diseases in varying environments
A1  - Trapman P.

A1  - Heesterbeek H. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - This paper is concerned with a stochastic model, describing outbreaks of infectious diseases that have potentially great animal or human health consequences, and which can result in such severe economic losses that immediate sets of measures need to be taken to curb the spread. During an outbreak of such a disease, the environment that the infectious agent experiences is therefore changing due to the subsequent control measures taken. In our model, we introduce a general branching process in a changing (but not random) environment. With this branching process, we estimate the probability of extinction and the expected number of infected individuals for different control measures. We also use this branching process to calculate the generating function of the number of infected individuals at any given moment. The model and methods are designed using important infections of farmed animals, such as classical swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease and avian influenza as motivating examples, but have a wider application, for example to emerging human infections that lead to strict quarantine of cases and suspected cases (e.g. SARS) and contact and movement restrictions. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

T1  - Fatal, virus-associated peripheral neuropathy and retinopathy in farmed Penaeus monodon in eastern Australia. II. Outbreak descriptions
A1  - Callinan R.B.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Outbreaks of 'peripheral neuropathy and retinopathy' (PNR) occurring during 2 consecutive growout periods (typically October-April) are described for an intensive Penaeus monodon farm in eastern Australia. In the 1998/99 growout period, outbreaks graded minor to severe occurred in 22 of 25 ponds, 12 to 25 wk post-stocking. In the severely affected index pond, harvested 8 wk after outbreak recognition in mid-January, estimated survival for the period late December to harvest was 50%. Minor to moderate losses could be attributed to PNR in the other ponds. Mean survival over the same period for the 14 ponds harvested within 5 wk of outbreak recognition was 93% (83 to 100%); for the 7 ponds harvested 5 to 8 wk after outbreak recognition was 79% (67 to 92%) and for the 3 unaffected ponds was 90% (86 to 95%). Analysis indicated a significantly lower risk (Fisher's exact p = 0.016) of an outbreak in the 2 ponds stocked only with postlarvae from one hatchery (D) versus the 18 ponds stocked only with postlarvae from 3 other hatcheries (A, B and C). In the 1999/2000 growout period, minor to severe PNR outbreaks occurred in all 26 ponds, each stocked with postlarvae from the same hatchery (E), 19 to 21 wk post-stocking. Stocking date in 1999/2000 appeared to influence PNR outbreak severity; for ponds stocked on 2 of the 7 stocking dates versus those stocked on remaining dates, the crude relative risks (CRR) of a severe outbreak, or either a moderate or severe outbreak, were 11.25 (1.55 < CRR < 81.40) and 2.63 (1.30 < CRR < 5.31), respectively. Although inconclusive, study findings are consistent with the hypothesis that 'gill-associated virus' (GAV), the putative causal pathogen identified in a separate pathological study, entered ponds via postlarvae, and that prevalence and/or severity of infection within postlarval batches influenced outbreak severity. The generally high survival in ponds harvested soon after outbreak recognition, together with PNR prevalence of approximately 50% in prawns collected from 4 ponds 7 wk before those ponds were recognised as affected, also suggest that GAV is highly infectious and that PNR has a relatively long incubation period and/or clinical course.

N2  - Because of a high prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, we conducted an epidemiological study to assess the need for systematic surveillance, as well as the value of applying barrier precautions to P. aeruginosa carriers. From July 1997 to February 1998, we conducted a prospective cohort study in an 18-bed medical intensive care unit (ICU), which is part of the infectious diseases department in a 1200-bed tertiary-care teaching hospital. Rectal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained on admission and twice weekly. Acquired strains were genotypically characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). A risk factor analysis for carriage, colonization and infection was performed. Among 269 eligible patients, 116 (43%) were P. aeruginosa carriers, with 46 (17%) detected on admission and 70 (26%) who acquired carriage during their stay in ICU. Among these 70 patients, 29 became colonized (N =13) or developed infection (N =16). Conversely, in the 121 patients who remained free of carriage, no colonization or infection were detected. Genotyping analysis using PFGE was performed for 81/85 (95%) acquired strains in 67 patients. The same genotype I was observed for 58/81 (70%) of these strains issued from 47 patients, and a distinct genotype II affected two other patients (three strains). The last 20 strains were not genetically related. In a multivariate model, mechanical ventilation was associated with the acquisition of P. aeruginosa carriage. Antibiotics ineffective against P. aeruginosa significantly increased the risk of colonization or infection in ICU. Although several recent studies concluded that endogenous sources account for the majority of P. aeruginosa colonizations or infections, we conclude that epidemiology may vary according to the ICU, and that cross-colonization (i.e., exogenous source) may occur and warrant reinforced barrier precautions. © 2002 The Hospital Infection Society.

T1  - Genetic management strategies for controlling infectious diseases in livestock populations
A1  - Bishop S.C.
A1  - MacKenzie K.M. 
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - This paper considers the use of disease resistance genes to control the transmission of infection through an animal population. Transmission is summarised by R0, the basic reproductive ratio of a pathogen. If R0 > 1.0 a major epidemic can occur, thus a disease control strategy should aim to reduce R0 below 1.0, e.g. by mixing resistant with susceptible wild-type animals. Suppose there is a resistance allele, such that transmission of infection through a population homozygous for this allele will be R02  1 and R02 < 1, the proportions of the two genotypes should be such that R0 <= 1, i.e. rho <= (R0 - R02)/(R01 - R02). If R02 = 0, the proportion of resistant animals must be at least 1 - 1/R01. For an n genotype model the requirement is still to have R0 <= 1.0. Probabilities of epidemics in genetically mixed populations conditional upon the presence of a single infected animal were derived. The probability of no epidemic is always 1/(R0 + 1). When R0 <= 1 the probability of a minor epidemic, which dies out without intervention, is R0/(R0 + 1). When R0 > 1 the probability of a minor and major epidemics are 1/(R0 + 1) and (R0 - 1)/(R0 + 1). Wherever possible a combination of genotypes should be used to minimise the invasion possibilities of pathogens that have mutated to overcome the effects of specific resistance alleles.

N2  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Since 1971, CDC, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists have maintained a collaborative surveillance system for collecting and periodically reporting data related to occurrences and causes of waterborne-disease outbreaks (WBDOs). This surveillance system is the primary source of data concerning the scope and effects of waterborne disease outbreaks on persons in the United States. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: This summary includes data on WBDOs associated with drinking water that occurred during January 2001-December 2002 and on three previously unreported outbreaks that occurred during 2000. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: Public health departments in the states, territories, localities, and the Freely Associated States are primarily responsible for detecting and investigating WBDOs and voluntarily reporting them to CDC on a standard form. The surveillance system includes data for outbreaks associated with both drinking water and recreational water; only outbreaks associated with drinking water are reported in this summary. RESULT(S): During 2001-2002, a total of 31 WBDOs associated with drinking water were reported by 19 states. These 31 outbreaks caused illness among an estimated 1,020 persons and were linked to seven deaths. The microbe or chemical that caused the outbreak was identified for 24 (77.4%) of the 31 outbreaks. Of the 24 identified outbreaks, 19 (79.2%) were associated with pathogens, and five (20.8%) were associated with acute chemical poisonings. Five outbreaks were caused by norovirus, five by parasites, and three by non-Legionella bacteria. All seven outbreaks involving acute gastrointestinal illness of unknown etiology were suspected of having an infectious cause. For the first time, this MMWR Surveillance Summary includes drinking water-associated outbreaks of Legionnaires disease (LD); six outbreaks of LD occurred during 2001-2002. Of the 25 non-Legionella associated outbreaks, 23 (92.0%) were reported in systems that used groundwater sources; nine (39.1%) of these 23 groundwater outbreaks were associated with private noncommunity wells that were not regulated by EPA. INTERPRETATION: The number of drinking water-associated outbreaks decreased from 39 during 1999-2000 to 31 during 2001-2002. Two (8.0%) outbreaks associated with surface water occurred during 2001-2002; neither was associated with consumption of untreated water. The number of outbreaks associated with groundwater sources decreased from 28 during 1999-2000 to 23 during 2001-2002; however, the proportion of such outbreaks increased from 73.7% to 92.0%. The number of outbreaks associated with untreated groundwater decreased from 17 (44.7%) during 1999-2000 to 10 (40.0%) during 2001-2002. Outbreaks associated with private, unregulated wells remained relatively stable, although more outbreaks involving private, treated wells were reported during 2001-2002. Because the only groundwater systems that are required to disinfect their water supplies are public systems under the influence of surface water, these findings support EPA's development of a groundwater rule that specifies when corrective action (including disinfection) is required. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: CDC and EPA use surveillance data 1) to identify the types of water systems, their deficiencies, and the etiologic agents associated with outbreaks and 2) to evaluate the adequacy of technologies for providing safe drinking water. Surveillance data are used also to establish research priorities, which can lead to improved water-quality regulations. CDC and EPA recently completed epidemiologic studies that assess the level of waterborne illness attributable to municipal drinking water in nonoutbreak conditions. The decrease in outbreaks in surface water systems is attributable primarily to implementation of provisions of EPA rules enacted since the late 1980s. Rules under development by EPA are expected to protect the public further from microbial contaminants while addressing risk tradeoffs of disinfection byproducts in drinking water.

N2  - After the Second World War, in Italy Q Fever or Coxiellosis has been shown a significant relevance, a recrudescence with an epidemic state for over ten years. Later, the infectious disease occurred as endemic since the 80s, the outbreaks were just isolated. Workflows analysis of some authors has demonstrated the spread out of the infection throughout Italian herds with a prevalence ranging from 1.2 per cent to 10 per cent. Our survey carried out throughout Campania area in cattle has shown a real positivity over 14 per cent performing the IFAT for the detection of IgG antibodies for Coxiella burnetii. Therefore, it has been so important to stress the influence of cattle farming management in stables as a real risk of Coxiellosis. For example, the Relative Risk (RR) has been registrated about 6.84 (2.18<RR<21.4) in comparison with some herds permanently housed than those kept unhoused and about 8.4 (1.8<RR<38.6) in housed herds and those permanently kept at pasture. Therefore, we have detected a seroprevalence of Q Fever about 11.8 per cent within sheep and about 6.3 per cent within goats. The investigations have focused buffaloes too, tested by several authors, especially from India, but in Italy, only Galiero has recorded significant results: the overall seroprevalence (1.2 per cent) was observed within 1012 buffaloes. Other studies have demonstrated that dogs may transmit Q Fever to humans by infected birth fluids and membranes and by urine. Because of this observation, addressed some of our search projects to assess possible relation among other pathogens, such as Leishmania infantum, Rickettsia conori and Ehrlichia canis. The results have confirmed the presence of C. burnetii (seroprevalence about 7 per cent) within tested dogs in southern Italy. There was no direct estimated relationship between C. burnetii and E. canis and R. conori, instead of significant relation has been shown for L. infantum. The investigation focused on the direct interaction between seropositivity and the age of ruminants. For example, the highest prevalence has been observed in cows and sheep ranging from 3-5 years in which the infection risk was higher than in younger herds. In accordance with the workflows serological analysis, C. burnetii is widespread in Italy among housed ruminants. PCR assay was, therefore performed to test cows with clinical signs of abortion and neonatal mortality. All the survey involved 305 animals (267 foeti and 38 stillborn) with 77 positive herds showing DNA of C. burnetii. To detect C. burnetii pathogen in milk samples, two methods have been combined: the immunomagnetic separation (IMS) and PCR assay, obtaining an increasing of sensitivity (10(-17)) more than only PCR technique (10(-8)). The overall analysis of serological and biomolecular results has demonstrated that C. burnetii is really widespread and may have detrimental effects on farm management system.

T1  - Epidemiology of a tuberculosis outbreak in a rural Missouri high school
A1  - Phillips L.
A1  - Carlile J.
A1  - Smith D. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: 1) Demonstrate the importance of maintaining a tuberculosis (TB) control program even in low-incidence areas by studying a TB-contact investigation of a highly infectious high school student in rural Missouri, and 2) discuss factors that perpetuated or contained this school-based outbreak. METHOD(S): A case review of the index patient, a 15-year-old high school student, established estimates of his level and duration of infectiousness. Contact investigations of his household (n = 5), high school (n = 781), and school bus (n = 67) were administered according to guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. High school students were stratified further based on classroom exposure, and relative risks were calculated for each risk group. RESULT(S): The case review revealed that the index patient had evidence of a pulmonary cavity on chest radiograph 6 months before his TB diagnosis. Of the 5 household contacts, all were infected and 3 (60%) had developed active TB disease. Of the 781 high school students sought for TB screening, 559 (72%) completed testing, and 58 (10%) were PPD-positive. Sixty-seven bus riders were sought for testing and 7 (19%) were purified protein derivative (PPD)-positive, with 1 bus rider subsequently diagnosed with active disease. Risks were calculated based on classroom and bus exposure to the patient. The relative risks for a positive PPD were 3.2 for attending any class with the patient (n = 25), 4.2 for classes with less ventilation (n = 21), and 5.7 for > or =3 classes (n = 7) with the patient. A total of 62 students started treatment for latent TB infection, and 49 have completed it. Forty-two of these students received directly observed therapy through the local public health agency and the high school. CONCLUSION(S): This investigation demonstrated widespread adult-type transmission from a pediatric TB case with a 6-month delay in diagnosis. Several actions contributed to the success of this investigation, including rapidly mobilizing the public health system, centralizing follow-up, and on-site testing and treatment with directly observed therapy. Pediatricians need to maintain awareness of TB and risk factors in children, even in low-incidence areas. Prompt diagnosis would have reduced the severity of illness in the patient and potentially prevented widespread school-based transmission. Public health authorities must maintain an infrastructure to respond to large TB outbreaks.

T1  - Real-time syndrome surveillance in Ontario, Canada: the potential use of emergency departments and Telehealth
A1  - Moore K. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to review new bioterrorist and emerging infectious threats to public health in Ontario, Canada, and to propose a means of integrating a telephone-based health information service and emergency department triage with a first-line real-time, 24-h a day syndrome surveillance system. This automated system could be beneficial in detecting a bioterrorist threat as well as in detecting and monitoring disease outbreaks such as influenza, Norwalk, West Nile virus, Escherichia coli 0157 or severe acute respiratory syndrome. METHOD(S): The Medline PubMed database was searched for articles relating to bioterrorism and syndromic surveillance from 1997 onwards. The websites of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, Ontario Ministry of Public Safety and Security, Centers for Disease Control and Canadian Population and Public Health Branch of Health Canada were searched for articles relating to bioterrorism and syndromic surveillance. Interviews were conducted with key informants from Telehealth staff, the public health services of Ontario and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA. RESULT(S): Real-time syndrome surveillance is a new means of detecting disease outbreaks or possibly acts of bioterrorism at the first contact with the healthcare system. It has been used successfully to detect influenza outbreaks at an early stage. The system that is proposed would be a province-wide integrated early warning system for both bioterrorist events and emerging infections. It would use clusters of symptoms tied to temporal, demographic and spatial data to increase sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION(S): Real-time syndrome surveillance is an evolving science. Emergency departments and Telehealth in Ontario lend themselves as first contacts to the healthcare system as excellent opportunities to perform syndrome surveillance. They offer the opportunity properly to identify at-risk patients for emerging infections by including contact and travel data into the symptom complex. This could identify at-risk patients early and lead to appropriate public health measures. The benefit of using Telehealth in Ontario is the provincial accessibility of Telehealth and the extensive data collected on one computerized system. Emergency departments should also have a uniform computerized triage data collection system to facilitate surveillance.

N2  - Data of the 1997-1998 epidemic of classical swine fever (CSF) in The Netherlands were analysed in survival analysis to identify risk factors that were associated with the rate of neighbourhood infections. The study population consisted of herds within 1000 m of exclusively one previously infected herd. Dates of virus introduction into herds were drawn randomly from estimated probability distributions per herd of possible weeks of virus introduction. (To confirm the insensitivity of the results for this random data-selection procedure, the procedure was repeated 9 times (resulting in 10 different datasets).) The dataset had 906 non-infected and 59 infected neighbour herds, which were distributed over 215 different neighbourhoods. Neighbour herds that never became infected were right-censored at the last date of the infectious period of the infected source herd. Neighbour herds that became empty within the infectious period or within the following 21 days due to preventive depopulation or due to the implemented buying-out programme were right-censored 21 days before the moment of becoming empty. This was done as a correction for the time a herd could be infected without being noticed as such. The median time to identified infection of neighbour herds was 2 weeks, whereas the median time to right censoring of non-infected neighbour herds was 3 weeks. The risk factors, radial distance <=500 m, cattle present on source herd and increasing herd size of the neighbour herd were associated multivariably with the hazard for neighbour herds to become infected. We did not find an association between time down wind and infection risk for neighbour herds. Radial dispersion of CSFV seemed more important in neighbourhood infections than dispersion along the road on which the infected source herd is situated. The results of this study support the strategy of preventive depopulation in the neighbourhood of an infected herd. Recommendations are presented to adapt the applied control strategy for neighbourhood infections. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T1  - The experience of the 2003 SARS outbreak as a traumatic stress among frontline healthcare workers in Toronto: Lessons learned
A1  - Maunder R. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the first half of 2003 in Canada was unprecedented in several respects. Understanding the psychological impact of the outbreak on healthcare workers, especially those in hospitals, is important in planning for future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. This review draws upon qualitative and quantitative studies of the SARS outbreak in Toronto to outline the factors that contributed to healthcare workers' experiencing the outbreak as a psychological trauma. Overall, it is estimated that a high degree of distress was experienced by 29-35% of hospital workers. Three categories of contributory factors were identified. Relevant contextual factors were being a nurse, having contact with SARS patients and having children. Contributing attitudinal factors and processes were experiencing job stress, perceiving stigmatization, coping by avoiding crowds and colleagues, and feeling scrutinized. Pre-existing trait factors also contributed to vulnerability. Lessons learned from the outbreak include: (i) that effort is required to mitigate the psychological impact of infection control procedures, especially the interpersonal isolation that these procedures promote; (ii) that effective risk communication is a priority early in an outbreak; (iii) that healthcare workers may have a role in influencing patterns of media coverage that increase or decrease morale; (iv) that healthcare workers benefit from resources that facilitate reflection on the effects of extraordinary stressors; and (v) that healthcare workers benefit from practical interventions that demonstrate tangible support from institutions.

T1  - Major foodborne illness causing viruses and current status of vaccines against the diseases
A1  - Atreya C.D. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Even though viruses, unlike bacteria, cannot grow in or on foods, foodborne illnesses are associated with viruses due to contamination of the fresh produce or processed food by virus-containing fecal material. The commonly reported major foodborne illnesses are due to Noroviruses, hepatitis A and E viruses, rotaviruses, and astroviruses. Among all illnesses caused by foodborne pathogens, recent estimates of as high as 67% have been attributed to viruses alone, and an upward trend in the of transmission of viruses by food and water has been recently acknowledged. Due to the highly infectious nature of these viruses and their survival under drastic conditions such as high acidic pH and low temperatures, it has long been recognized that immunization against such pathogens is the ideal solution to provide protection against the illness and disease outbreaks associated with these viruses. With an increased recognition of the clinical significance and impact of acute viral illness associated with food and water in humans of all ages, there has been a recent surge in developing prophylactic vaccines against such viruses. So far, except for hepatitis A virus, there are no vaccines available to prevent illness associated with foodborne viruses. Outbreaks of hepatitis A have been significantly reduced due to widespread immunization of some risk groups. It is clear from the literature that novel strategies currently in development may lead to vaccines against noroviruses and rotaviruses in the near future, offering hope that such vaccines will significantly reduce the burden associated with foodborne illnesses associated with these viruses.

A1  - Hovding G. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Acute infectious conjunctivitis is the eye disease most commonly seen by general practitioners, and is estimated to represent 2 - 3 % of their total number of consultations. The present paper gives a review of the epidemiology, etiology, clinical picture, complications, differential diagnoses and therapy of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. The condition has an excellent prognosis with a high frequency of spontaneous remission. However, topical antibacterial therapy should always be instituted, because this will shorten the course of the disease and reduce the risk of epidemic outbreaks, particularly in institutions for children.

T1  - Diarrheal illnesses: a public health perspective
A1  - Ocfemia C.B.
A1  - Taylor C. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Diarrheal illnesses remain among the leading causes of morbidity in the United States. Approximately five million diarrheal cases occur annually (Chin, 2000; Ostroff & Leduc, 2000), with an estimated incidence of one diarrheal episode per person per year (Aranda-Michel & Giannella, 1999). Though the causes of diarrheal illnesses vary, infectious agents account for a majority of cases (Aranda-Michel & Giannella, 1999; Chin, 2000; Ostroff & Leduc, 2000). Most diarrhea-causing infectious agents are transmitted through food, water, or person-to-person via the fecal-oral route and are the cause of numerous diarrheal outbreaks. The risk for exposure to such pathogens within the general population is universal; however, persons in pediatric, geriatric, and other immunocompromised populations are at increased risk for subsequent illness and complications (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2001; Ostroff & Leduc, 2000). Moreover, many persons with diarrheal illness do not seek medical care and self-treat with over-the-counter antidiarrheal agents, which have potentially serious side effects among high-risk individuals. The public health impact of diarrheal illness is apparent and emphasizes the need for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, timely notification of illness with public health implications, and coordination between healthcare professionals and public health officials to prevent and control the spread of infection.

T1  - Bonaparte's expedition in Egypt
T3  - Aspects humanitaires et medicaux de la reddition de l'armee d'Orient (1799-1801)
A1  - Richet G. 
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Bonaparte's expedition in Egypt was not only a military operation. It was also a tentative colonial move which was used as a model for over a century as well as a cultural and scientific adventure, quite unique for its time. The evacuation of the Oriental Army stands as a milestone in the history of civilisations because the protocols which marked its achievement - to which Desgenettes and Larrey contributed-displayed outstanding humanitarian and medical dimensions. The humanitarian dimension is highlighted by the remarkable contribution of the British Authorities in taking care of the wounded, sick and disabled as well as in ensuring that the French troops safely got home or dealing with the various civilian people not following the army back to France. These agreements between belligerents clearly anticipated what became, 63 years later, the cornerstone of the Red Cross. The medical dimension is illustrated with all the sanitary measures which were taken in order to keep away from any risk of plague epidemics which were rightly feared at the time. Scurvy was also an issue. Although Lind had stated its "deficiency" characteristic 50 years earlier scurvy was still considered as an infectious and contagious disease. Not surprisingly the remarkable 3000 case study made by Larrey, which undoubtedly led up to the conclusion that the disease stemmed exclusively from nutritional deficiencies, had been almost neglected.

T1  - Epidemic theory and group violence
A1  - Patten S.B.
A1  - Arboleda-Florez J.A. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Background: Epidemics can be represented mathematically using a variety of models. One of these, the Kermack-McKendrick model, has been used to support health policy decisions concerning vaccination requirements. An unrelated body of literature suggests that some behaviours, including some types of violence, may spread in ways analogous to the contagious spread of infectious diseases, a process that has been characterized as "behavioural contagion". Method(s): Various parameter values reflecting the characteristics of crowds were substituted into the Kermack-McKendrick model. Computer simulations were used to evaluate the impact of these parameter values. Result(s): The simulations reproduced several features of crowd violence: the tendency for riots to occur in large groups, the importance of rapid removal of violent individuals from crowds, and the roles of alcohol consumption and social identification processes. Conclusion(s): Epidemic models may be of relevance to the prevention and control of violent behaviour as they can assist with the identification of high-risk situations and prevention strategies. Theoretical constructs related to epidemic theory may have broad applicability for modelling the unstable course of some mental disorders. © Steinkopff Verlag 2004.

T1  - Hepatitis A outbreaks - Methods of intervention in South-East Asian countries
A1  - David A.M. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Introduction: In many Asian countries, improved hygiene standards and socio-economic conditions have led to a reduction in exposure to the hepatitis A virus (HAV) in childhood. However, the persistence of circulating HAV may lead to hepatitis A outbreaks, particularly in adolescents and adults. In other countries and specific areas, where socio-economic conditions have not improved as markedly, HAV endemicity remains medium-to-high. A systematic approach to outbreak control is therefore urgently needed. Method(s): The Steering Committee for Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases reviewed reports on recent hepatitis A outbreaks in South-East Asian countries and determined that there is no systematic regional plan for the containment of such outbreaks. By contrast, on reviewing reports on outbreaks in several North American and European countries, it was found that the most important elements of successful outbreak control are a plan of action, rapid and widespread communication, public education and vaccination of household contacts to prevent secondary cases. Result(s): This investigation proposes an outbreak control programme consisting of six key stages - initiation, planning, set-up, implementation, vaccination of at-risk populations and evaluation. Outbreak control requires the formation of an outbreak management team, plus a task force to implement intervention and educate the public. The vaccination of family members and close contacts is a central element of the programme. Conclusion(s): This model programme for hepatitis A outbreak control provides a framework for action in countries and specific areas where the disease remains a problem. © 2004 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

N2  - We propose a transmission model to estimate the main characteristics of influenza transmission in households. The model details the risks of infection in the household and in the community at the individual scale. Heterogeneity among subjects is investigated considering both individual susceptibility and infectiousness. The model was applied to a data set consisting of the follow-up of influenza symptoms in 334 households during 15 days after an index case visited a general practitioner with virologically confirmed influenza. Estimating the parameters of the transmission model was challenging because a large part of the infectious process was not observed: only the dates when new cases were detected were observed. For each case, the data were augmented with the unobserved dates of the start and the end of the infectious period. The transmission model was included in a 3-levels hierarchical structure: (i) the observation level ensured that the augmented data were consistent with the observed data, (ii) the transmission level described the underlying epidemic process, (iii) the prior level specified the distribution of the parameters. From a Bayesian perspective, the joint posterior distribution of model parameters and augmented data was explored by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. The mean duration of influenza infectious period was estimated at 3.8 days (95 per cent credible interval, 95 per cent CI [3.1,4.6]) with a standard deviation of 2.0 days (95 per cent CI [1.1,2.8]). The instantaneous risk of influenza transmission between an infective and a susceptible within a household was found to decrease with the size of the household, and established at 0.32 person day-1 (95 per cent CI [0.26,0.39]); the instantaneous risk of infection from the community was 0.0056 day-1 (95 per cent CI [0.0029,0.0087]). Focusing on the differences in transmission between children (less than 15 years old) and adults, we estimated that the former were more likely to transmit than adults (posterior probability larger than 99 per cent), but that the mean duration of the infectious period was similar in children (3.6 days, 95 per cent CI [2.3,5.2]) and adults (3.9 days, 95 per cent CI [3.2,4.9]). The posterior probability that children had a larger community risk was 76 per cent and the posterior probability that they were more susceptible than adults was 79 per cent.

N2  - Despite improved control measures, Ebola remains a serious public health risk in African regions where recurrent outbreaks have been observed since the initial epidemic in 1976. Using epidemic modeling and data from two well-documented Ebola outbreaks (Congo 1995 and Uganda 2000), we estimate the number of secondary cases generated by an index case in the absence of control interventions (R0). Our estimate of R0 is 1.83 (SD 0.06) for Congo (1995) and 1.34 (SD 0.03) for Uganda (2000). We model the course of the outbreaks via an SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) epidemic model that includes a smooth transition in the transmission rate after control interventions are put in place. We perform an uncertainty analysis of the basic reproductive number R0 to quantify its sensitivity to other disease-related parameters. We also analyse the sensitivity of the final epidemic size to the time interventions begin and provide a distribution for the final epidemic size. The control measures implemented during these two outbreaks (including education and contact tracing followed by quarantine) reduce the final epidemic size by a factor of 2 relative the final size with a 2-week delay in their implementation. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Infection, reinfection, and vaccination under suboptimal immune protection: Epidemiological perspectives
A1  - Gomes M.G.M.
A1  - White L.J.
A1  - Medley G.F. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The SIR (susceptible-infectious-resistant) and SIS (susceptible-infectious- susceptible) frameworks for infectious disease have been extensively studied and successfully applied. They implicitly assume the upper and lower limits of the range of possibilities for host immune response. However, the majority of infections do not fall into either of these extreme categories. We combine two general avenues that straddle this range: temporary immune protection (immunity wanes over time since infection), and partial immune protection (immunity is not fully protective but reduces the risk of reinfection). We present a systematic analysis of the dynamics and equilibrium properties of these models in comparison to SIR and SIS, and analyse the outcome of vaccination programmes. We describe how the waning of immunity shortens inter-epidemic periods, and poses major difficulties to disease eradication. We identify a "reinfection threshold" in transmission when partial immunity is included. Below the reinfection threshold primary infection dominates, levels of infection are low, and vaccination is highly effective (approximately an SIR model). Above the reinfection threshold reinfection dominates, levels of infection are high, and vaccination fails to protect (approximately an SIS situation). This association between high prevalence of infection and vaccine failure emphasizes the problems of controlling recurrent infections in high-burden regions. However, vaccines that induce a better protection than natural infection have the potential to increase the reinfection threshold, and therefore constitute interventions with a surprisingly high capacity to reduce infection where reduction is most needed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The recent emergence of monkey pox in the United States of America highlights the problem (known for other infectious agents) of dissemination of pathogens outside their endemic area, and of subsequent global threats of variable gravity according to agents. It is a real emergency since monkey pox had been confined to Africa for several decades, where small epidemics occurred from time to time. monkey pox is a "miniature smallpox" which, in Africa, evolves on an endemic (zoonotic) mode with, as reservoirs, several species of wild rodents (mainly squirrels) and some monkey species. It can be accidentally transmitted to man then develops as epidemics, sometimes leading to death. The virus was imported in 2003 in the United States of America, via Gambia rats and wild squirrels (all African species), and infected prairie dogs (which are now in fashion as pets), then crossed the species barrier to man. In the United States of America, screening campaigns, epidemiological investigations, and subsequent treatments led to a rapid control of the epidemic, which is a model of emergent disease for this country. Therapeutic and preventive measures directly applicable to monkey pox are discussed. They can also be applied against other pox virus infections (including smallpox). The risk of criminal introduction of pox viruses is discussed since it is, more than ever, a real worldwide threat. © 2003 Elsevier SAS. Tous droits reserves.

N2  - Anthropogenic land use changes drive a range of infectious disease outbreaks and emergence events and modify the transmission of endemic infections. These drivers include agricultural encroachment, deforestation, road construction, dam building, irrigation, wetland modification, mining, the concentration or expansion of urban environments, coastal zone degradation, and other activities. These changes in turn cause a cascade of factors that exacerbate infectious disease emergence, such as forest fragmentation, disease introduction, pollution, poverty, and human migration. The Working Group on Land Use Change and Disease Emergence grew out of a special colloquium that convened international experts in infectious diseases, ecology, and environmental health to assess the current state of knowledge and to develop recommendations for addressing these environmental health challenges. The group established a systems model approach and priority lists of infectious diseases affected by ecologic degradation. Policy-relevant levels of the model include specific health risk factors, landscape or habitat change, and institutional (economic and behavioral) levels. The group recommended creating Centers of Excellence in Ecology and Health Research and Training, based at regional universities and/or research institutes with close links to the surrounding communities. The centers' objectives would be 3-fold: a) to provide information to local communities about the links between environmental change and public health; b) to facilitate fully interdisciplinary research from a variety of natural, social, and health sciences and train professionals who can conduct interdisciplinary research; and c) to engage in science-based communication and assessment for policy making toward sustainable health and ecosystems.

N2  - Introduction: In 2000, a syphilis outbreak was identified in Ireland. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective enhanced database was established in 2000. Crude incidence rates for the general population, men who have sex with men (MSM), and HIV-positive MSM were calculated. Result(s): Three hundred fifty-six cases of infectious syphilis were diagnosed at 1 center. Eighty-five percent of cases were identified as MSM. Crude incidence rates in MSM, ranging in age between 20 and 44 years, peaked in 2001 at 719 cases per 100,000 of the MSM population. A total of 17.4% of cases occurred in HIV-infected individuals. Crude incidence rates of syphilis in HIV-positive MSM in the center increased to 7280 per 100,000. Similar percentages of MSM with and without HIV infection had unprotected anal intercourse (37% and 41%, respectively). Conclusion(s): High-risk sexual behavior continues among HIV-infected and -noninfected MSM. Crude incidence rates among MSM in Ireland are alarming when compared with other outbreaks.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - In 1996, an outbreak of E. coli 0157:H7-associated illness occurred in an elementary school in Japan. This outbreak has been studied in unusual detail, making this an important case for quantitative risk assessment. The availability of stored samples of the contaminated food allowed reliable estimation of exposure to the pathogens. Collection of fecal samples allowed assessment of the numbers infected, including asymptomatic cases. Comparison to other published dose-response studies for E. coli 0157:H7 show that the strain that caused the outbreak studied here must have been considerably more infectious. We use this well-documented incident as an example to demonstrate how such information on the response to a single dose can be used for dose-response assessment. In particular, we demonstrate how the high infectivity limits the uncertainty in the low-dose region.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - This article estimates the risk of tuberculosis (TB) transmission on a typical commercial airliner using a simple one box model (OBM) and a sequential box model (SBM). We used input data derived from an actual TB exposure on an airliner, and we assumed a hypothetical scenario that a highly infectious TB source case (i.e., 108 infectious quanta per hour) travels as a passenger on an 8.7-hour flight. We estimate an average risk of TB transmission on the order of 1 chance in 1,000 for all passengers using the OBM. Applying the more realistic SBM, we show that the risk and incidence decrease sharply in a stepwise fashion in cabins downstream from the cabin containing the source case assuming some potential for airflow from more contaminated to less contaminated cabins. We further characterized spatial variability in the risk within the cabin by modeling a previously reported TB outbreak in an airplane to demonstrate that the TB cases occur most likely within close proximity of the source TB patient.

N2  - Detection and identification of pathogenic bacteria and their protein toxins play a crucial role in a proper response to natural or terrorist-caused outbreaks of infectious diseases. The recent availability of whole genome sequences of priority bacterial pathogens opens new diagnostic possibilities for identification of bacteria by retrieving their genomic or proteomic information. We describe a method for identification of bacteria based on tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis of peptides derived from bacterial proteins. This method involves bacterial cell protein extraction, trypsin digestion, liquid chromatography MS/MS analysis of the resulting peptides, and a statistical scoring algorithm to rank MS/MS spectral matching results for bacterial identification. To facilitate spectral data searching, a proteome database was constructed by translating genomes of bacteria of interest with fully or partially determined sequences. In this work, a prototype database was constructed by the automated analysis of 87 publicly available, fully sequenced bacterial genomes with the GLIMMER gene finding software. MS/MS peptide spectral matching for peptide sequence assignment against this proteome database was done by SEQUEST. To gauge the relative significance of the SEQUEST-generated matching parameters for correct peptide assignment, discriminant function (DF) analysis of these parameters was applied and DF scores were used to calculate probabilities of correct MS/MS spectra assignment to peptide sequences in the database. The peptides with DF scores exceeding a threshold value determined by the probability of correct peptide assignment were accepted and matched to the bacterial proteomes represented in the database. Sequence filtering or removal of degenerate peptides matched with multiple bacteria was then performed to further improve identification. It is demonstrated that using a preset criterion with known distributions of discriminant function scores and probabilities of correct peptide sequence assignments, a test bacterium within the 87 database microorganisms can be unambiguously identified.

T1  - Yellow fever: The recurring plague
A1  - Tomori O. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Despite the availability of a safe and efficacious vaccine, yellow fever (YF) remains a disease of significant public health importance, with an estimated 200,000 cases and 30,000 deaths annually. The disease is endemic in tropical regions of Africa and South America; nearly 90% of YF cases and deaths occur in Africa. It is a significant hazard to unvaccinated travelers to these endemic areas. Virus transmission occurs between humans, mosquitoes, and monkeys. The mosquito, the true reservoir of YF, is infected throughout its life, and can transmit the virus transovarially through infected eggs. Man and monkeys, on the other hand, play the role of temporary amplifiers of the virus available for mosquito infection. Recent increases in the density and distribution of the urban mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, as well as the rise in air travel increase the risk of introduction and spread of yellow fever to North and Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, and Oceania. It is an acute infectious disease characterized by sudden onset with a two-phase development, separated by a short period of remission. The clinical spectrum of yellow fever varies from very mild, nonspecific, febrile illness to a fulminating, sometimes fatal disease with pathognomic features. In severe cases, jaundice, bleeding diathesis, with hepatorenal involvement are common. The case fatality rate of severe yellow fever is 50% or higher. The pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disease are poorly understood and have not been the subject of modern clinical research. There is no specific treatment for YF, making the management of YF patients extremely problematic. YF is a zoonotic disease that cannot be eradicated, therefore instituting preventive vaccination through routine childhood vaccination in endemic countries, can significantly reduce the burden of the disease. The distinctive properties of lifelong immunity after a single dose of yellow fever vaccination are the basis of the new applications of yellow fever 17D virus as a vector for foreign genes, "the chimeric vaccine," and the promise of developing new vaccines against other viruses, and possibly against cancers.

N2  - Objective: To assess the contribution of primary or acute HIV infection to the transmission of HIV among homosexual men in Amsterdam and to investigate how the . initiation of treatment during primary HIV infection (PHI) can affect the incidence of HIV infection. Method(s): A mathematical model describing HIV transmission among homosexual men was developed. In the model, men are involved in both steady and casual partnerships. Infectivity is higher during PHI than during chronic HIV infection. Highly active antiretroviral therapy reduces infectivity and increases the time to the development of AIDS. Its effect is enhanced if treatment is initiated during PHI. HIV incidence and the fraction of transmission attributed to PHI were calculated for different levels of treatment efficacy. Result(s): Primary infections account for 35% of HIV transmissions from casual partners and 6% of transmissions from steady partners. Among all new infections, only 11% occurs during PHI. Therefore, the effect of treatment during PHI on the incidence of HIV is limited. However, in a community with higher risky behaviour among casual partners, the fraction of transmission attributed to PHI increases to 25%. Conclusion(s): Primary infections play a more important role in transmission from casual partners than in transmission from steady partners. Therefore, in communities in which steady partners account for the majority of new infections and the epidemic is at an advanced phase, the contribution of PHI to the transmission of HIV is rather small and the effect of early treatment on the incidence of HIV is limited. ©2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

T1  - Epidemiologic Determinants for Modeling Pneumonic Plague Outbreaks
A1  - Gani R.
A1  - Leach S. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Pneumonic plague poses a potentially increasing risk to humans in plague nonendemic regions either as a consequence of an aerosolized release or through importation of the disease. Pneumonic plague is person-to-person transmissible. We provide a quantitative assessment of transmissibility based on past outbreaks that shows that the average number of secondary cases per primary case (R0) was 1.3 (variance = 3.1), assuming a geometric probability distribution, prior to outbreak control measures. We also show that the latent and infectious periods can be approximated by using lognormal distributions with means (SD) of 4.3 (1.8) and 2.5 (1.2) days. Based on this parameter estimation, we construct a Markov-chain epidemic model to demonstrate the potential impact of delays in implementing outbreak control measures and increasing numbers of index cases on the incidence of cases in simulated outbreaks.

T1  - A nested-epidemic model for the spread of hepatitis C among injecting drug users
A1  - Esposito N.
A1  - Rossi C. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Injecting drug users (IDUs) are the largest risk group for HCV infection. Studying injecting by classical epidemiological methods is no easy task, largely due to its hidden nature and low prevalence in general population terms. Thus, mathematical modelling can be of major help in performing a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the costs and possible impact of the various interventions and to produce forecasts of both injecting drug use and HCV spread among IDUs. In the present paper an epidemic Mover-Stayer model for the spread of drug use, which has been recently proposed, is extended to mirror the spread of an infectious disease, in particular hepatitis C, among the injecting drug user population. In order to model the spread of a disease (HCV) among a population evolving following a different epidemic (injecting drug use) all the compartments of the 'external epidemic' (injecting drug use) are subdivided into two sub-compartments: the first one comprising individuals who are not affected by HCV and the second one comprising individuals affected. The resulting model may be defined the 'two epidemics' or, better, the 'nested epidemics' model. The model is a Mover-Stayer model for what concerns the 'external epidemic' (injecting drug use) but is a homogeneous epidemic model for HCV (all individuals are at risk of HCV the same). In the following, the dynamic equations are derived. Some qualitative analysis is performed in order to evaluate the asymptotic behaviour and the impact of possible prevention or harm reduction interventions. The results of a scenario analysis are also presented. The model, though simple, seems to be a very valuable tool for policy makers. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - The Contribution of Genetic Diversity to the Spread of Infectious Diseases in Livestock Populations

A1  - Woolliams J.A.
A1  - Bishop S.C. 
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - This article uses stochastic simulations with a compartmental epidemic model to quantify the impact of genetic diversity within animal populations on the transmission of infectious disease. Genetic diversity is defined by the number of distinct genotypes in the population conferring resistance to microparasitic (e.g., viral or bacterial) infections. Scenarios include homogeneous populations and populations composed of few (finite-locus model) or many (infinitesimal model) genotypes. Genetic heterogeneity has no impact upon the expected value of the basic reproductive ratio (the primary description of the transmission of infection) but affects the variability of this parameter. Consequently, increasing genetic heterogeneity is associated with an increased probability of minor epidemics and decreased probabilities of both major (catastrophic) epidemics and no epidemics. Additionally, heterogeneity per se is associated with a breakdown in the expected relationship between the basic reproductive ratio and epidemic severity, which has been developed for homogeneous populations, with increasing heterogeneity generally resulting in fewer infected animals than expected. Furthermore, increased heterogeneity is associated with decreased disease-dependent mortality in major epidemics and a complex trend toward decreased duration of these epidemics. In summary, more heterogeneous populations are not expected to suffer fewer epidemics on average, but are less likely to suffer catastrophic epidemics.

T1  - Influenza vaccination and antiviral therapy: Is there a role for concurrent administration in the institutionalised elderly?
A1  - Drinka P.J. 
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Influenza vaccination is estimated to be 50-68% efficacious in preventing pneumonia, hospitalisation or death in nursing home residents. Large culture-proven outbreaks may occur despite high resident vaccination rates. There is, therefore, a significant role for concurrent administration of influenza vaccination and antiviral therapy. The use of antiviral treatment and chemoprophylaxis requires community reporting of viral isolates, and contingency plans for rapid case identification and application of antiviral therapy. Clinicians must react quickly to control a highly infectious seasonal pathogen that may strike as an explosive outbreak. This situation is unique in geriatric practice. Current antiviral treatment should be administered within 48 hours of symptom onset, and is more efficacious if administered within 12 hours. In the case of an explosive institutional outbreak, a 1-day delay in prophylaxis may allow infection of many residents with a potentially fatal illness. Influenza must be differentiated from other respiratory viruses or syndromes. Grouped rapid diagnostic tests can aid laboratory confirmation. Antiviral agents include the M2 inhibitors, amantadine and rimantadine, active against influenza A, and the neuraminidase inhibitors, zanamivir and oseltamivir, active against influenza A and B. In our experience, influenza B illness is as severe as influenza A. All agents have similar efficacy as treatment and prophylaxis against sensitive strains. When M2 inhibitors are used simultaneously within an enclosed space (i.e. household or nursing home) as both treatment and prophylaxis, resistant strains may emerge that limit prophylactic efficacy. When M2 inhibitors are administered to suspected cases (residents or staff) in institutions, precautions against secretion are especially important to diminish the risk of transmission of resistant virus. Rimantadine has been shown to have significantly fewer CNS adverse events compared with amantadine. Amantadine and oseltamivir require dosage adjustment in those with renal impairment. Oseltamivir, rimantadine and amantadine are administered by mouth, while zanamivir is administered by oral inhalation in a lactose powder. The labelling advises caution in the use of zanamivir in those with underlying airway disease. Pooled analysis of studies in patients given zanamivir indicate that individuals over the age of 50 years (at high risk for complications) and those severely symptomatic at presentation, tend to benefit most from early treatment. Neuraminidase inhibitors also diminish the need for antibacterials to treat secondary complications. An institutional programme to control influenza should include vaccination, and contingency plans for clinical surveillance, specimen processing and the rapid application of antiviral treatment and prophylaxis.

N2  - A dynamic model of risky behavior in the midst of an epidemic is discussed. The key result is that pessimistic expectations over the future of the epidemic induce more current risky behavior. Numerical simulation of equilibrium epidemics shows that this effect can accelerate spread of the disease in an epidemic's early stages and that the effect of policy interventions, such as preventative vaccines, may depend on whether the intervention was anticipated. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

N2  - Vaccination has proved a powerful defence against a range of infectious diseases of humans and animals. However, its potential to control major epidemics of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in livestock is contentious. Using an individual farm-based model, we consider either national prophylactic vaccination campaigns in advance of an outbreak, or combinations of reactive vaccination and culling strategies during an epidemic. Consistent with standard epidemiological theory, mass prophylactic vaccination could reduce greatly the potential for a major epidemic, while the targeting of high-risk farms increases efficiency. Given sufficient resources and preparation, a combination of reactive vaccination and culling might control ongoing epidemics. We also explore a reactive strategy, 'predictive' vaccination, which targets key spatial transmission loci and can reduce markedly the long tail that characterizes many FMD epidemics. These analyses have broader implications for the control of human and livestock infectious diseases in heterogeneous spatial landscapes.

N2  - A stochastic model of equine influenza (EI) is constructed to assess the risk of an outbreak in a Thoroughbred population at a typical flat race training yard. The model is parameterised using data from equine challenge experiments conducted by the Animal Health Trust (relating to the latent and infectious period of animals) and also published data on previous epidemics (to estimate the transmission rate for equine influenza). Using 89 ponies, an empirical relationship between pre-challenge antibody and the probability of becoming infectious is established using logistic regression. Changes in antibody level over time are quantified using published and unpublished studies comprising 618 ponies and horses. A plausible Thoroughbred population is examined over the course of a year and the model is used to assess the risk of an outbreak of EI in the yard under the current minimum vaccination policy in the UK. The model is adapted to consider an alternative vaccination programme where the frequency of vaccination in older horses (2-year-olds and upwards) is increased. Model results show that this practical alternative would offer a significant increase in protection. Spread of infection between yards is also considered to ascertain the risk of secondary outbreaks. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Background: Since the discovery in 1989 of hepatitis C virus (HCV) as the infectious agent responsible for the vast majority of post-transfusion non-A non-B hepatitis the patterns of transmission and clinical consequences of this highly prevalent flavivirus have been widely studied. Objective(s): This paper reviews available evidence on the epidemiology of HCV infection in Australia, including HCV notification data obtained through public health surveillance systems, HCV seroprevalence surveys among high risk populations, and models for estimating and projecting HCV transmission and long-term consequences of chronic HCV infection. Result(s): Over the period 1990-2000 approximately 160 000 notifications of HCV infection were received by State and Territory health jurisdictions making it the most commonly notified communicable disease in Australia. Approximately 210 000 people are estimated to be living with HCV infection in Australia, with an estimated 80% having acquired their infection through injecting drug use. Less than 500 cases of newly acquired HCV infection are notified each year, however, an estimated 16 000 new infections occur annually. Despite the widespread introduction of needle and syringe programmes in the late 1980s, HCV transmission continues at high levels among current injecting drug users (IDUs) with incidence and prevalence estimates of 10-20/100 person years and 50-55%, respectively. Levels of HCV transmission are particularly high in both younger and incarcerated IDUs. In contrast to HCV infection, prevalence of HIV among current IDUs has remained below 2% since 1995. Although a small minority of people with chronic HCV infection will develop liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma, the incidence of these advanced disease complications is estimated to double over the next decade. Conclusion(s): The epidemic of HCV infection continues to escalate in Australia, predominantly through transmission related to injecting drug use. As the population of people with chronic HCV infection and progressive liver disease expands the public health burden of advanced disease complications will be considerable. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Study objective: Coeliac disease, also called permanent gluten sensitive enteropathy, is being recognised as a widespread health problem. Defining the possible role of environmental factors in its aetiology might open doors to primary prevention. This study therefore analysed if the risk for coeliac disease varies with month of birth as a proxy for a seasonal pattern for possible causal environmental exposure(s). Design(s): A population based incidence register of coeliac disease in children below 15 years of age covering the period from 1973 to 1997. Incidence rates were calculated by month of birth, stratified for age at diagnosis. Poisson regression analyses were used to estimate the relative risk for coeliac disease for children below 2 years of age by season of birth, also taking into account gender and time period of diagnosis. Setting(s): Sweden. Participant(s): All 2151 children in the study base with verified coeliac disease. Main Result(s): The risk for coeliac disease was significantly higher if born during the summer as compared with the winter (RR=1.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.7), but only in children below 2 years of age at diagnosis. This relative seasonal risk pattern prevailed during a 10 year epidemic of coeliac disease, although incidence rates varied threefold. The incidence was constantly higher among girls as campared with boys, but boys showed a more pronounced seasonal variation in risk than girls. Conclusion(s): An increased coeliac disease risk in children born in the summer compared with the winter reflects causal environmental exposure(s) with a seasonal pattern. Infections might be the exposure of importance, either by means of a direct causal role and/or through interaction with other exposures, for example, gluten intake. However, non-infectious exposures should also be explored as possible contributing causal factors.

N2  - Background: Since 1995, the incidence of Chlamydia trachomatis infection has been increasing in Finland, although there have been no major changes in public sexually transmitted disease (STD) services or screening practice. Objective(s): The objective was to study whether the change in C. trachomatis incidence is significant and to identify specific risk groups. Method(s): The incidence rates for all C. trachomatis cases notified by laboratories to the National Infectious Disease Register (NIDR) in Finland in 1995-2000 were calculated by gender, age, and domicile. Data from a sentinel STD surveillance network was used to analyze changes of risk-taking behavior in age groups with the highest C. trachomatis rates. Result(s): During the 6-year study period, laboratory surveillance data documented an increase in the incidence rate from 23.4 per 10,000 to 29.2 per 10,000. The increase was most evident among people living in nonurban densely populated areas. Highest increase, 1.37-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29-1.46) in women and 1.69-fold (CI, 1.47-1.92) in men, occurred in the youngest age group (10-19 years old). In 2000, more women, but not men, in the age group of 10-29 years reported 5 or more annual sex partners (18.8%; CI, 16.3-21.6) than in 1995 (8.3%; CI, 5.7-11.5). Conclusion(s): National surveillance of C. trachomatis infection based on laboratory notification documented increasing incidence rates, especially among adolescents and young people. This risk group should be a target for screening and educational programs to control the epidemic of C. trachomatis infections.

N2  - Emerging infectious diseases pose a growing threat to human populations. Many of the world's epidemic diseases (particularly those transmitted by intermediate hosts) are known to be highly sensitive to long-term changes in climate and short-term fluctuations in the weather. The application of environmental data to the study of disease offers the capability to demonstrate vector-environment relationships and potentially forecast the risk of disease outbreaks or epidemics. Accurate disease forecasting models would markedly improve epidemic prevention and control capabilities. This chapter examines the potential for epidemic forecasting and discusses the issues associated with the development of global networks for surveillance and prediction. Existing global systems for epidemic preparedness focus on disease surveillance using either expert knowledge or statistical modelling of disease activity and thresholds to identify times and areas of risk. Predictive health information systems would use monitored environmental variables, linked to a disease system, to be observed and provide prior information of outbreaks. The components and varieties of forecasting systems are discussed with selected examples, along with issues relating to further development.

T1  - Effect of breastfeeding on infant and child mortality due to infectious diseases in less developed countries: A pooled analysis
A1  - Victora C.G.
A1  - Barros A.J.D. 
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Background: The debate on breastfeeding in areas of high HIV prevalence has led to the development of simulation models that attempt to assess the risks and benefits associated with breastfeeding. An essential element of these simulations is the extent to which breastfeeding protects against infant and child mortality; however, few studies are available on this topic. We did a pooled analysis of studies that assessed the effect of not breastfeeding on the risk of death due to infectious diseases. Method(s): Studies were identified through consultations with experts in international health, and from a MEDLINE search for 1980-98. Using meta-analytical techniques, we assessed the protective effect of breastfeeding according to the age and sex of the infant, the cause of death, and the educational status of the mother. Finding(s): We identified eight studies, data from six of which were available (from Brazil, The Gambia, Ghana, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Senegal). These studies provided information on 1223 deaths of children under two years of age. In the African studies, virtually all babies were breastfed well into the second year of life, making it impossible to include them in the analyses of infant mortality. On the basis of the other three studies, protection provided by breastmilk declined steadily with age during infancy (pooled odds ratios: 5.8 [95% CI 3.4-9.8] for infants < 2 months of age, 4.1 [2.7-6.4] for 2-3-month-olds, 2.6 [1.6-3.9] for 4-5-month-olds, 1.8 [1.2-2.8] for 6-8-month-olds, and 1.4 [0.8-2.6] for 9-11-month-olds). In the first 6 months of life, protection against diarrhoea was substantially greater (odds ratio 6.1 [4.1-9.01) than against deaths due to acute respiratory infections (2.4 [1.6-3.5]). However, for infants aged 6-11 months, similar levels of protection were observed (1.9 [1.2-3.1] and 2.5 [1.4-4.6], respectively). For second-year deaths, the pooled odds ratios from five studies ranged between 1.6 and 2.1. Protection was highest when maternal education was low. Interpretation(s): These results may help shape policy decisions about feeding choices in the face of the HIV epidemic. Of particular relevance is the need to account for declining levels of protection with age in infancy, the continued protection afforded during the second year of life, and the question of the safety of breastmilk substitutes in families of low socioeconomic status.

N2  - A mass immunization campaign with a Urabe-containing measles-mumps-rubella vaccine was carried out in 1997 in the city of Salvador, northeastern Brazil, with a target population of children aged 1-11 years. There was an outbreak of aseptic meningitis following the mass campaign. Cases of aseptic meningitis were ascertained through data collected from the records of children admitted to the local referral hospital for infectious diseases between March and October of 1997, using previously defined eligibility criteria. Vaccination histories were obtained through home visits or telephone calls. Eighty- seven cases fulfilled the study criteria. Of those, 58 cases were diagnosed after the vaccination campaign. An elevated risk of aseptic meningitis was observed 3 weeks after Brazil's national vaccination day compared with the risk in the prevaccination period (relative risk = 14.3; 95% confidence interval: 7.9, 25.7). This result was confirmed by a case series analysis (relative risk = 30.4; 95% confidence interval: 11.5, 80.8). The estimated risk of aseptic meningitis was 1 in 14,000 doses. This study confirms a link between measles-mumps-rubella vaccination and aseptic meningitis. The authors discuss the implications of this for the organization and planning of mass immunization campaigns.

N2  - An unresolved issue in the epidemiology of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the UK is what precisely determines the degree to which cases of disease in cattle are clustered within herds throughout the course of the epidemic. This paper presents an analysis of feed-borne transmission at the herd level and tests various models of case-clustering mechanisms, associated with heterogeneity in exposure to infectious feed, against observed epidemic pattern. We use an age-structured metapopulation framework in which the recycling of animal tissue between herds via feed producers is explicitly described. We explore two alternative assumptions for the scaling with herd size of the within-herd risk of exposure of an animal to infectious material. We find that whereas exposure heterogeneity caused by variation in feed and offal processing methods and by variation in per-animal feed uptake can explain the pattern of case clustering seen in the BSE epidemic, exposure heterogeneity due to the aggregation of infectivity within feed cannot.

N2  - A decision-tree was developed to support decision making on control measures during the first days after the declaration of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). The objective of the tree was to minimise direct costs and export losses of FMD epidemics under several scenarios based on livestock and herd density in the outbreak region, the possibility of airborne spread, and the time between first infection and first detection. The starting point of the tree was an epidemiological model based on a deterministic susceptible-infectious-recovered approach. The effect of four control strategies on FMD dynamics was modelled. In addition to the standard control strategy of stamping out and culling of high-risk contact herds, strategies involving ring culling within 1 km of an infected herd, ring-vaccination within 1 km of an infected herd, and ring-vaccination within 3 km of an infected herd were assessed. An economic model converted outbreak and control effects of farming and processing operations into estimates of direct costs and export losses. Ring-vaccination is the economically optimal control strategy for densely populated livestock areas whereas ring culling is the economically optimal control strategy for sparsely populated livestock areas.

T1  - Coevolution of pathogens and cultural practices: a new look at behavioral heterogeneity in epidemics
A1  - Tanaka M.M.

A1  - Feldman M.W. 
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - The effect of heterogeneity within populations on the spread of infectious diseases has been a recent focus of research. Such heterogeneity may be, for example, spatial, temporal or behavioral in form. Generally, models that include population subdivision have assumed that individuals are permanently assigned to given behavioral states represented by the subpopulations. We consider a simple epidemic model in which a behavioral trait affects disease transmission, and this trait may be transferred among hosts as a consequence of social interaction. This creates a situation where the frequencies of different behavioral traits and disease states as well as their associations may change over time. We consider the impact of the culturally transmitted trait on the criterion for initial spread of the disease. We also explore the evolution of cultural traits in response to pathogen dynamics and show some conditions under which behavioral traits that reduce transmission evolve. We find that behaviors increasing the risk of infection can also evolve when they are inherently favored or when there is sufficient clustering of contacts between like behaviors.

N2  - Knowledge of the sensitivity of diagnostic tests for infectious diseases under field conditions can be used to design a surveillance program that increases the effectiveness of the control policy. In this study, the sensitivity of tests for the detection of classical swine fever (CSF) virus (CSFV) under field conditions was estimated without knowledge of the true disease status of the animals tested. During the CSF epidemic of 1997-1998 in The Netherlands, tonsil samples from pigs of CSF suspect farms were collected for laboratory diagnosis of CSE These specimens were tested in a fluorescence antibody test (FAT1) for the presence of CSFV antigen. When at least 1 specimen in a particular sample series from a farm was positive, this farm was declared CSFV infected. Specimens of that series, either FAT1 negative (98) or FAT1 positive (127), were subsequently tested again (FAT2). After that, a suspension was made of the remaining tissue, and this suspension was evaluated with a virus isolation test. In total, 225 tonsil specimens were examined. A statistical model was formulated, and the sensitivity of the 3 tests and the prevalence of positive specimens in the sample were estimated by the method of maximum likelihood. The sensitivity of the FAT1, the test that was used for confirmation of CSFV infection in a pig herd, was approximately 78% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 62-92%). The effectiveness of the selection process of animals on the farm by the veterinarian was estimated to be 77% (64-87%). The sensitivity of the combination of FAT1 and FAT2 (60%) indicates that at least 5 animals should be selected on a CSF-suspect farm to gain a detection probability for CSFV of 99%.

T1  - Population-based interventions for reducing sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection
A1  - Wilkinson D.
A1  - Rutherford G. 
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted infections (STI) are common in developing countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that in 1995, 333 million new cases of syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis occurred. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is also common in developing countries. UNAIDS estimates that over 90% of the 33 million people infected with HIV by December 1999 live in developing countries (UNAIDS 1999). The STI and HIV epidemics are interdependent. Similar behaviours, such as frequent unprotected intercourse with different partners, place people at high risk of both infections, and there is clear evidence that conventional STIs increase the likelihood of HIV transmission. Several studies have demonstrated a strong association between both ulcerative and non-ulcerative STIs, and HIV infection (Cameron 1989, Laga 1993) and there is biological evidence that the presence of an STI increases shedding of HIV and that STI treatment reduces HIV shedding (Cohen 1997, Robinson 1997). Therefore, STI control may have the potential to contribute substantially to HIV prevention. OBJECTIVE(S): To determine the impact of population-based STI interventions on the frequency of HIV infection, frequency of STIs and quality of STI management. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following electronic databases were searched for relevant randomised trials or reviews: 1) MEDLINE for the years 1966 to current using the search terms sexually transmitted diseases and human immunodeficiency virus infection 2) The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness and the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register in the most recent issue of the Cochrane Library 3) The specialist register of trials maintained by the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group. 4) EMBASE The abstracts of relevant conferences were searched and reference lists of all review articles and primary studies were scanned. Finally, authors of included trials and other experts in the field were contacted as appropriate. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials in which the unit of randomisation is either a community or a treatment facility. Studies where individuals are randomised were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria to potential studies with any disagreements resolved by discussion. Trials were examined for completeness of reporting. The methodological quality of each trial was assessed by the same two reviewers with details recorded of randomisation method, blinding, use of intention-to-treat analysis and the number of patients lost to follow-up using standard guidelines of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group. MAIN RESULTS: Four trials were included. Frequency of HIV infection: In Rakai, after 3 rounds of treatment of all community members for STIs the rate ratio of incident HIV infection was 0.97 (95%CI 0.81 to 1.16), indicating no effect of the intervention. In Mwanza, the incidence of HIV infection in the intervention groups (strengthened syndromic management of STIs in primary care clinics) was 1.2% compared with 1.9% in the control groups (OR=0.58, 95% CI 0.42-0.70), corresponding to a 38% reduction (95%CI 15% to 55%) in HIV incidence in the intervention group. Frequency of STIs: In both Mwanza and Rakai, there was no significant reduction in gonorrhoea, chlamydia, urethritis, or reported STI symptoms among intervention communities. The prevalence ratio of syphilis between intervention and control groups in Rakai was 0.8 (95%CI 0.71-0.89), of trichmoniasis was 0.59 (0.38-0.91), and of bacterial vaginosis was 0.87 (0.74-1.02). In Mwanza, the prevalence of serologically diagnosed syphilis in the intervention community was 5% compared with 7% in the control community at the end of the trial (adjusted relative risk 0.71 (95%CI 0.54-0.93). Quality of treatment: In Lima, following training of pharmacy assistants in STI syndromic management, symptoms were recognised as being due to an STI in 65% of standardised simulated patients (SSPs) visiting intervention and 60% of SSPs visiting control pharmacies (p=0.35). Medication was offered without referral to a doctor in most cases (83% intervention and 78% control, p=0.61). Of those SSPs offered medication, only 1.4% that visited intervention pharmacies and only 0.7% of those that visited control pharmacies (p=0.57) were offered a recommended regimen. Similarly in only 15% and 16% of SSP visits respectively was any recommended drug offered. However, education and counseling were more likely to be given to SSPs visiting intervention pharmacies (40% vs 27%, p=0.01). No SSPs were given partner cards or condoms. In Hlabisa, following the intervention targeting primary care clinic nurses (strengthened STI syndromic management and provision of STI syndrome packets containing recommended drugs, condom, partner cards and patient information leaflets), SSPs were more likely to be given recommended drugs in intervention clinics (83% vs 12%, p <0.005) and more likely to be correctly case managed [given correct drugs, partner cards and condoms] (88% vs 50%, p <0.005). There were no significant difference in the proportions adequately counseled (68% vs 46%, p=0.06), experiencing good staff attitude (84% vs 58%, p=0.07), and being consulted in privacy (92% vs 86%, p=0.4). There was no strong evidence of any impact on treatment seeking behaviour, utilisation of services, or sexual behaviour in any of the four trials. REVIEWERS' CONCLUSION(S): There is limited evidence from randomised controlled trials for STI control as an effective HIV prevention strategy. Improved STI treatment services have been shown to reduce HIV incidence in an environment characterised by an emerging HIV epidemic (low and slowly rising prevalence), where STI treatment services are poor and where STIs are highly prevalent. There is no evidence for substantial benefit from treatment of all community members. There are however other compelling reasons why STI treatment services should be strengthened and the available evidence suggests that when an intervention is accepted it can substantially improve quality of services provided. Further community based randomised controlled trials that test a range of alternative STI control strategies are needed in a variety of different settings. Such trials should aim to measure a range of factors that include health seeking behaviour and quality of treatment as well as HIV, STI and other biological endpoints.

T1  - Influenza: from vaccine prevention to antiviral therapy
T3  - La grippe: de la prevention vaccinale au traitement antiviral
A1  - Nkoghe D.
A1  - Scheen A.J. 
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Influenza is a highly infectious disease responsible for dangerous epidemics, especially in patients at high risk. The vaccine exerts a valuable protective effect estimated up to 70% and is still considered as the key-approach against influenza. Antiviral agents of the first generation (amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirine) have limited use because of poor tolerance and occurrence of resistance. Zanamivir or Relenza, marketed by Glaxo Wellcome, is a new virostatic drug acting as a neuraminidase inhibitor. It prevents the release of new viruses and so stop the propagation of the infection. It must be taken orally by inhalation within 48 hours after the onset of symptoms. The treatment lasts 5 days (10 mg twice daily). Its efficacy has been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials, and its tolerance is generally excellent. However, caution is recommended in patients with asthma and chronic bronchitis because of the potential risk of bronchoconstriction. No resistance has been detected until now. Zanamivir is active on all strains of influenza A and B viruses.

T1  - A space-time cluster investigation of an outbreak of acute respiratory disease in Norwegian cattle herds
A1  - Norstrom M.
A1  - Pfeiffer D.U.
A1  - Jarp J. 
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Outbreaks of acute respiratory disease occurred in several cattle herds in the south-east regions of Norway during the winter and spring of 1995. The present study was conducted to investigate the temporal and spatial dynamics of the occurrence of acute respiratory disease between January and April 1995 in the affected cattle herds, in two neighbouring counties in Norway. This was done to assess the possible role of an infectious agent in these outbreaks, as well as to investigate the possibility of transmission between neighbouring herds. During the study period, a total of 190 (19.8%) outbreaks occurred in 955 cattle herds located in the defined study area. Descriptive maps of the spatial and spatio-temporal patterns of the outbreak were generated, and two different statistical tests of space-time interaction (the Knox test and k-nearest neighbour test) and a cluster-detection test (the space-time scan statistic) were used. The results of all the space-time interaction tests strongly suggested that the case herds were clustered in time as well as in space. In addition, the space-time scan statistic defined the most-likely cluster to be located within the second veterinary district (Toten where the disease occurred) during 9-15 weeks in 1995. The relative risk of a herd being infected inside the most-likely cluster compared with the surrounding study area was estimated to be 3.59 (p = 0.001). The transmission rate between neighbouring farms therefore appeared to have been higher within this cluster than in the surrounding study area. This study supports the hypothesis that one common source of infection was involved in the outbreaks during the study period. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

T1  - Hierarchial statistical modelling of influenza epidemic dynamics in space and time

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - An infectious disease typically spreads via contact between infected and susceptible individuals. Since the small-scale movements and contacts between people are generally not recorded, available data regarding infectious disease are often aggregations in space and time, yielding small-area counts of the number infected during successive, regular time intervals. In this paper, we develop a spatially descriptive, temporally dynamic hierarchical model to be fitted to such data. Disease counts are viewed as a realization from an underlying multivariate autoregressive process, where the relative risk of infection incorporates the space-time dynamic. We take a Bayesian approach, using Markov chain Monte Carlo to compute posterior estimates of all parameters of interest. We apply the methodology to an influenza epidemic in Scotland during the years 1989-1990. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - Hot spots in a wired world: WHO surveillance of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases
A1  - Heymann D.L.
A1  - Rodier G.R. 
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - The resurgence of the microbial threat, rooted in several recent trends, has increased the vulnerability of all nations to the risk of infectious diseases, whether newly emerging, well-established, or deliberately caused. Infectious disease intelligence, gleaned through sensitive surveillance, is the best defence. The epidemiological and laboratory techniques needed to detect, investigate, and contain a deliberate outbreak are the same as those used for natural outbreaks. In April 2000, WHO formalised an infrastructure (the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network) for responding to the heightened need for early awareness of outbreaks and preparedness to respond. The Network, which unites 110 existing networks, is supported by several new mechanisms and a computer-driven tool for real time gathering of disease intelligence. The procedure for outbreak alert and response has four phases: systematic detection, outbreak verification, real time alerts, and rapid response. For response, the framework uses different strategies for combating known risks and unexpected events, and for improving both global and national preparedness. New forces at work in an electronically interconnected world are beginning to break down the traditional reluctance of countries to report outbreaks due to fear of the negative impact on trade and tourism. About 65% of the world's first news about infectious disease events now comes from informal sources, including press reports and the internet.

T1  - Impact of vaccinations on the epidemiology of infective diseases
T3  - Influence des vaccinations sur l'epidemiologie des maladies infectieuses
A1  - Begue P. 
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Immunizations may progressively modify the epidemiology and the clinical features of some infectious diseases, partially explained by a shift of ages towards adults. For measles, the coverage in France is low (80%) and mean age of measles cases has raised from 7 to 9 years (40% of cases are more than 10 years old). Measles may be more severe diseases in adolescents and adults, and for this reason a second dose of MMR vaccine has been recommended using a predictive mathematical model of measles epidemiology. Nevertheless, an important focus of measles remains in France (17,954 cases in 1999) and the risk of outbreaks in adolescents and adults is always present if immunization coverage for 24 months infants and catch-up are not improved quickly. Rubella has the same profile, with two outbreaks in young adults (1993 and 1997) followed by a peak of congenital rubella. Pertussis immunization has always been well applied in France. Resurgence started in the 90's, with pertussis in young adults (some being immunized in infancy) who transmitted pertussis to very young infants, not yet properly immunized. The situation requires a better immunity for old children and adults. For this reason, a booster is recommended in France at 11-13 years, and perhaps in adult later, these late boosters are practicable with the new acellular pertussis vaccines. Varicella vaccine is not in the french immunization schedule, for the same argument of risk of varicella in adults in cases of insufficiency of the coverage. Now USA recommend the vaccine in children, but a strong surveillance has been established. Those four examples observed in the french recent immunization policy emphasize the necessity for a stronger and new surveillance of immunizations and infectious preventable diseases.

T1  - Within-farm spread of classical swine fever virus--a blueprint for a stochastic simulation model
A1  - Stark K.D.
A1  - Pfeiffer D.U.
A1  - Morris R.S. 
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - A stochastic simulation model to investigate the transmission of classical swine fever (CSF) virus within an infected farm is described. The model is structured according to the processes that occur within and between management groups (pig units or houses). It uses the individual pig as the unit of interest and estimates the number of animals in the states 'susceptible', 'infected', 'infectious', and 'removed' for each day of the disease incident. Probabilities are assigned to the transitions between states. The probability of a pig becoming infected is made dependent on the probability of contact between a susceptible and an infectious pig as well as the probability of transmission. The more pigs become infected in one unit, the more likely is subsequent spread to another management group on the farm. Ultimately, the probability that a shipment of pigs from the farm will include at least one infected pig can be estimated in order to identify high-risk movements during a CSF epidemic. The model results were compared with experimental data on CSF transmission within one pig unit (management group). It could be shown that the model was capable of reproducing the experimentally observed infection and mortality rates. To improve the input parameters and for further model validation, more experimental data and field data from CSF outbreaks are needed.

T1  - Effect of environmental temperature on the ability of Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae) to transmit West Nile virus
A1  - Dohm D.J.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Environmental temperature can affect the ability of mosquitoes to transmit an arbovirus. However, results of various studies indicate that these effects are not consistent among viruses or mosquito species, and there is no information available on the effect of environmental temperature on the ability of North American mosquito species to transmit West Nile (WN) virus. We evaluated the effect of incubation temperature (18, 20, 26, or 30 degrees C) on the ability of Culex pipiens L. derived from specimens collected during the outbreak in New York in 1999 to transmit a strain of WN virus obtained from a crow that died during this outbreak. Although mosquitoes fed on the same viremic chickens, infection rates were directly related to subsequent incubation temperatures. In mosquitoes held at 30 degrees C, virus was recovered from nearly all mosquitoes tested, disseminated infections were detected as early as 4 d after the infectious blood meal, and >90% of all mosquitoes had a disseminated infection 12 or more days after the infectious blood meal. In contrast, for mosquitoes held at 18 degrees C, disseminated infections were not detected until 25 d after the infectious blood meal, and even after 28 d, <30% contained a disseminated infection. Results for mosquitoes held at 20 and 26 degrees C were intermediate for both infection and dissemination rates. The effect of environmental temperature should to be considered when evaluating the vector competence of these mosquitoes and modeling risk of WN virus transmission in nature.

T1  - Mathematical modelling of pseudorabies virus (syn. Aujeszky's disease virus) outbreaks aids eradication programmes: a review
A1  - van Nes A. 
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Pseudorabies virus will be eradicated from the Netherlands if a typical infectious pig (Rind) infects, on average, less than one other pig. In this review, we used a stochastic SIR model to estimate Rind using data from the field and from experiments. Rind in sow herds was estimated to be significantly less than 1 and in rearing and finishing pigs Rind was higher than 1. However, if Rind is higher than 1, PRV can still be eradicated if one infectious herd infects less than one other herd during the period that the herd is infectious(Rherd <1). Some future developments in Dutch pig husbandry (e.g. group-housing of sows) and possible risks after halting vaccination are also quantitatively evaluated.

N2  - Due to certain specificities in the HIV epidemic, its spread has escaped the random transmission pattern of other infectious diseases. Observation of the epidemic has shown that individual behavior - relational patterns among individuals - plays a crucial role in HIV transmission and that strategies to prevent the epidemic's spread should take this factor into account in order to foster efficient allocation of existing resources. Mathematical and statistical models applying the behavioral approach to the epidemic have estimated interactions between groups whose characteristics and behaviors varied. However, such models have been more "post-dictive" than predictive, due to the inadequate representation of social structures in populations through which infectious agents spread. The social network methodology thus came to be applied to the approach to the HIV epidemic. This article discusses alternatives for the application of this methodology to the Brazilian epidemic, considering that sociometric risk networks structure the flow of infectious agents in communities, creating unique opportunities to interrupt their spread.

N2  - The spatial spread of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is influenced by several sources of spatial heterogeneity: heterogeneity of the exposure to the virus, heterogeneity of the animal density and heterogeneity of the networks formed by the contacts between farms. A discrete space model assuming that farms can be reduced to points is proposed to handle these different factors. The farm-to-farm process of transmission of the infection is studied using point-pattern methodology. Farm management, commercial exchanges, possible airborne transmission, etc. cannot be explicitly taken into account because of lack of data. These latter factors are introduced via surrogate variables such as herd size and distance between farms. The model is built on the calculation of an infectious potential for each farm. This method has been applied to the study of the 1967-1968 FMD epidemic in UK and allowed us to evaluate the spatial variation of the probability of infection during this epidemic. Maximum likelihood estimation has been conducted conditional on the absence of data concerning the farms which were not infected during the epidemic. Model parameters have then been tested using an approximated conditional-likelihood ratio test. In this case study, results and validation are limited by the lack of data, but this model can easily be extended to include other information such as the effect of wind direction and velocity on airborne spread of the virus or the complex interactions between the locations of farms and the herd size. It can also be applied to other diseases where point approximation is convenient. In the context of an increase of animal density in some areas, the model explicitly incorporates the density and known epidemiological characteristics (e,g. incubation period) in the calculation of the probability of FMD infection. Control measures such as vaccination or slaughter can be simply introduced, respectively, as a reduction of the susceptible population or as a reduction of the source of infection. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

T1  - Utilizing stochastic genetic epidemiological models to quantify the impact of selection for resistance to infectious diseases in domestic livestock
A1  - MacKenzie K.
A1  - Bishop S.C. 
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - This paper demonstrates the use of stochastic genetic epidemiological models for quantifying the consequences of selecting animals for resistance to a microparasitic infectious disease. The model is relevant for many classes of infectious diseases where sporadic epidemics occur, and it is a powerful tool for investigating the costs, benefits, and risks associated with breeding for resistance to specific diseases. The model is parameterized for transmissible gastroenteritis, a viral disease affecting pigs, and selection for resistance to this disease on a structured pig farm is simulated. Two genetic models are used, both of which involve selection of sires. The first involves selection with the assumption of continuous genetic variation (the continuous selection model). The second involves selection with the assumption of introgression of a major recessive gene that confers resistance (the gene introgression model). In the base population, the basic reproductive ratio, R0 (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases after the introduction of a single infected animal) was 2.24, in agreement with previous studies. The probabilities of no epidemic, a minor epidemic (one that dies out without intervention), and a major epidemic were 0.55, 0.20, and 0.25, respectively. Selection for resistance, under both genetic models, resulted in a nonlinear decline in the probability of a major epidemic and a decrease in the severity of the epidemic, should it occur, until R0 was less than 1.0, at which point the probability of a major epidemic was zero. For minor epidemics, the probability and severity of the epidemic increased until R0 reached 1.0, at which point the probabilities also fell to zero. The epidemic probabilities were critically dependent on the location on the farm where infected animals were situated, and the relative risks of different groups of animals changed with selection. The main difference between the two genetic models was in the time scale; the introgression results simply depended on how quickly the resistance allele could be introgressed into the population. For the introgression model, the probability of a major epidemic declined to zero when 0.6 of the animals were homozygous for the resistance allele.

T1  - Developing stochastic epidemiological models to quantify the dynamics of infectious diseases in domestic livestock
A1  - MacKenzie K.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - A stochastic model describing disease transmission dynamics for a microparasitic infection in a structured domestic animal population is developed and applied to hypothetical epidemics on a pig farm. Rational decision making regarding appropriate control strategies for infectious diseases in domestic livestock requires an understanding of the disease dynamics and risk profiles for different groups of animals. This is best achieved by means of stochastic epidemic models. Methodologies are presented for 1) estimating the probability of an epidemic, given the presence of an infected animal, whether this epidemic is major (requires intervention) or minor (dies out without intervention), and how the location of the infected animal on the farm influences the epidemic probabilities; 2) estimating the basic reproductive ratio, R0 (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases on the introduction of a single infected animal) and the variability of the estimate of this parameter; and 3) estimating the total proportion of animals infected during an epidemic and the total proportion infected at any point in time. The model can be used for assessing impact of altering farm structure on disease dynamics, as well as disease control strategies, including altering farm structure, vaccination, culling, and genetic selection.

T1  - Risk and economics of disease introduction to dairy farms
T3  - Risico en economie van insleep van ziekten op melkveebedrijven
A1  - van Schaik G. 
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - A more closed farming system will enhance the success of disease eradication programmes, because the introduction or re-introduction of infectious diseases is less likely. The objective of the study was to obtain input for the development of an on-farm decision support model to calculate the economic consequences of a more closed farming system. The input was based on bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1), since there were numerous data on this disease, but a more closed farming system will prevent introduction of other diseases as well (i.e. bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV), L. hardjo, and S. dublin). Direct animal contacts, such as purchase of cattle, participation in cattle shows, and cattle that escape and mingle with other cattle, were found to be important risk factors for the introduction of BHV1. Furthermore, the use of protective farm clothing was found to be an important preventive factor. The effect of an IBR outbreak at an IBR-free farm on milk production caused limited losses of on average 0.9 kg per cow per day during 9 weeks, but the variability was high (95% CI 0-2 kg). Nine percent of Dutch IBR-free dairy farms that were also at risk for BVDV, L. hardjo or S. dublin had one introduction per year of one of these four diseases. All these results were incorporated in the economic model. Management measures to reduce the probability of introduction of BHV1, the costs of these measures, and the risk reduction after these measures were obtained from other sources. The calculations showed that the implementation of a more closed system will be profitable for most farms. The profitability will increase when a farm is at risk for more diseases, but will decrease when farms are limited in their facilities to rear replacement heifers or when a large proportion of pasture adjoins pasture of other cattle farms.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - A generalization of the standard susceptible-infectious-removed stochastic model for epidemics in sparse random networks is introduced which incorporates contact tracing in addition to random screening. We propose a deterministic mean-field description that yields quantitative agreement with stochastic simulations on random graphs. Both the stochastic simulations and the mean-field equations show secondary epidemics if the contact tracing is not performed with sufficient strength. We also analyze the role of contact tracing in epidemics control in small-world networks and show that its effectiveness grows as the rewiring probability is reduced. © 2002 The American Physical Society.

T1  - Infectious diseases on the Island of Rab as a tourist destination
T3  - Zarazne bolesti otoka Raba kao turisticke destinacije
A1  - Tomulic K. 
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - On the Island of Rab, the risk of acquiring an acute infectious disease depends primarily on geographic, bioclimatic, ecological and migratory conditions, more during tourist season, than in the early season or after it. Based on records of one outpatient general practice clinic, the author tried to analyze relevant infectious diseases that occur among island inhabitants, and whether and in what way does the inflow of tourists affect their occurrence. Due to their relative isolation, island inhabitants can serve as a good model for monitoring the course of disease and type of its spread. A subpopulation was monitored by conducting a single or multiple examinations in the period of one year and compared to the number of reported patients suffering from an infectious disease on the entire island. Seasonal manifestation of most frequent infectious diseases is shown, including zoonoses from the northern Croatian coastline. Since some foreign countries do not have law regulated obligatory vaccination for their population, we should also pay attention to some infectious diseases that in our areas almost never occur. Migration of population is an inevitable process that also causes transmission of infectious diseases. Only with adequate surveillance we can prevent their epidemic spread.

T1  - Further studies to quantify the dose of natural aerosols of foot-and-mouth disease virus for pigs
A1  - Alexandersen S.
A1  - Donaldson A.I. 
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) can be spread by a variety of mechanisms, including wind. Simulation models, developed to predict the risk of airborne spread, have played an important part in decision making in some outbreaks. The amount of airborne virus excreted as well as the minimal infectious dose (MID) of FMDV for different species are important determinants of airborne spread. The objective of this study was to obtain data for the O1 Lausanne, O SKR 2000 and O UKG 2001 strains of FMDV to enhance the capability of such models. Pigs were exposed to naturally generated aerosols of the three strains using an experimental design which delivered high doses of the two strains O1 Lausanne and O SKR 2000 over a short period, or of the O UKG 2001 strain over an extended period. The average excretion of the O1 Lausanne strain was 106.4 TCID50 per pig per hour. The excretion of the O SKR 2000 strain averaged 105.8 and the O UKG 2001 strain 106.1 TCID per pig per 24 h. The results show that the previous estimate of 'above' 800 TCID50 as the MID50 for the O1 Lausanne strain is a considerable under-estimate and that the real dose may be as high as 6000 TCID50. A dose of around 650 TCID50 of the O SKR 2000 strain failed to infect any pigs. Thus, the aerosol MID50 for pigs for this isolate is at least 1000 TCID50 and likely to be as high or higher than the O1 Lausanne strain. The exposure of pairs of recipient pigs kept physically separated from donor pigs in a series of rooms to aerosol exposure doses of the O UKG 2001 strain of around 50 TCID50 per min for 24-48 h failed to infect any of eight pigs. Thus, the present experiment confirms our previous findings [1, 2] that pigs, compared to cattle and sheep, are relatively resistant to infection with airborne FMDV.

N2  - Developing effective policy for environmental health issues requires integrating large collections of information that are diverse, highly variable, and uncertain. Despite these uncertainties in the science, decisions must be made. These decisions often have been based on risk assessment. We argue that two important features of risk assessment are to identify research needs and to provide information for decision making. One type of information that a model can provide is the sensitivity of making one decision over another on factors that drive public health risk. To achieve this goal, a risk assessment framework must be based on a description of the exposure and disease processes. Regarding exposure to waterborne pathogens, the appropriate framework is one that explicitly models the disease transmission pathways of pathogens. This approach provides a crucial link between science and policy. Two studies-a Giardia risk assessment case study and an analysis of the 1993 Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Cryptosporidium outbreak-illustrate the role that models can play in policy making.

N2  - Background: A heterogeneous geographic distribution of MS has been reported among different ethnic groups, and also within small communities. Epidemiologic studies conducted over the past two decades using repeated assessments clearly show that Sardinia is at high risk for MS, with a prevalence of 150 per 100,000 in 1997. Objective(s): To present spatial analysis of the disease prevalence to disclose possible "hot" or "cold" spots of disease, further allowing correlations with risk factors. Method(s): A spatial analysis of the whole province of Sassari, in northern Sardinia, at a microgeographic level (i.e., in the 89 administrative communes and 6 linguistic areas) was conducted. Because of the small number of cases per commune and to overcome random variability, a hierarchical Bayesian approach was adopted. The distribution of prevalent cases by commune of residence on December 31, 1997 and from age 5 to 15 years was analyzed. Result(s): A clustering pattern was found in the southwestern communes of the province based on geographic distribution by both prevalence and residence at age 5 to 15 years. A west-to-east gradient also was observed. Conclusion(s): This study highlights a hot spot of MS in the southwestern part of Sassari province, bordering with the commune of Macomer, where MS was once hypothesized as having occurred as an epidemic. Interestingly, these areas of MS clustering comprise the Common Logudorese linguistic domain. The Catalan area, linguistically and genetically distant from the remaining Sardinian domains, does not show such high estimates. Because MS is not a single-source infectious disease, this study may help test the hypothesis that a widely and evenly spread environmental (infectious?) agent may produce disease in subgroups of genetically more susceptible individuals in areas at higher inbreeding rates, wherein a disease mode of inheritance could be better investigated.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Risk factors for waterborne enteric infections are deduced primarily from outbreak surveillance data; however, in the United States, only a fraction of the estimated water-related outbreaks are reported through passive surveillance. In the past several years, advances in molecular detection techniques have furthered our knowledge about foodborne and waterborne causes of gastroenteritis, allowing the association of certain pathogens with biologic and exposure-related susceptibilities in their hosts. This article summarizes some of the recent data characterizing susceptibility to three common waterborne pathogens: Cryptosporidium, a protozoan; Norwalk-like virus; and the bacterium Escherichia coli O157:H7. The infectious dose of Cryptosporidium varies by several orders of magnitude by strain, and repeated low-level exposure in drinking water may be protective. Some people may be innately immune to Norwalk-like virus, despite multiple exposures. A major risk factor for E. coli O157:H7 infection is exposure to shallow groundwater sources contaminated with animal waste. © 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - In medium and long lasting mass events, community health protection -through risk prevention, epidemiological monitoring and promotion of healthy habits- is as important as an appropriate individual health care and the preparation of a collective emergency plan. There is scant literature regarding this topic and, in particular, regarding sports events. Hence, the announcement of the organization in Seville on August 1999 of the 7th IAAF Athletics World Championship was a great challenge for health authorities. The development -both empirical and normative- that has taken place in Andalusia over the past ten years and the transfer of the ultimate responsibility in public health matters to the Government of this autonomous region, entailed the creation of a multi-institutional Health Commission, that participated in the Championship Organizing Committee with five working groups -one of them specialized in this discipline- that wrote action protocols in the fields of water and food hygiene, environmental health and control of infectious diseases, hot-related disorders and sexually-transmitted diseases, as an attempt to coordinate all the resources available. The procedures established by the Commission, the action methodology and the interventions performed are described in this paper: 40 hotels and 108 restaurants and bars were inspected, 177 food handlers were controlled, 172 samples from processed foods were prospectively analyzed, 8 catering services for more than 7,000 official guests were assessed, 65 samples of water and critical points were inspected for the control of Legionella, repeated sessions on DDD were organized and more than 10,000 leaflets were distributed for the promotion of a healthy sexuality, along with the same number of condoms. Only an outbreak of slight acute gastroenteritis was detected, affecting 13 volunteers, and no changes were objectified in the notifications received by the network of health alerts as compared to previous and later years. The active involvement of the coordinating center for urgencies and emergencies was very positive, facilitating the transmission and management of notifications and the computerized recording of a comprehensive information system.

T1  - An algorithmic synthesis of the deterministic and stochastic paradigms via computer intensive methods
A1  - Mode C.J.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - In this paper, an approach to synthesizing the deterministic and stochastic paradigms, via computer intensive methods, is presented within the framework of a stochastic model of a HIV/AIDS epidemic in a population of homosexuals. Because of dependence among members of a population, the problem of determining threshold conditions was approached by systematically embedding a system of differential equations in a stochastic process and determining if the Jacobian matrix of this system is stable or not stable, when evaluated at a disease free equilibrium. It has been shown in numerous Monte Carlo simulation experiments that if this matrix is not stable, then an epidemic will develop in a population with positive probability, following the introduction of infectives into a population of susceptibles. This technique was used to search for points in the parameter space such that an epidemic would develop in a population of susceptibles, following the entrance of one or more infectious recruits during any time interval with small probability. Such recurrent rare events are of interest in the studying the emergence of new diseases, involving the transmission of a virus from a species that has evolved resistance to it to another species that lacks resistance. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

T1  - A general model for stochastic SIR epidemics with two levels of mixing
A1  - Ball F.
A1  - Neal P. 
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - This paper is concerned with a general stochastic model for susceptible -> infective -> removed epidemics, among a closed finite population, in which during its infectious period a typical infective makes both local and global contacts. Each local contact of a given infective is with an individual chosen independently according to a contact distribution 'centred' on that infective, and each global contact is with an individual chosen independently and uniformly from the whole population. The asymptotic situation in which the local contact distribution remains fixed as the population becomes large is considered. The concepts of local infectious clump and local susceptibility set are used to develop a unified approach to the threshold behaviour of this class of epidemic models. In particular, a threshold parameter R* governing whether or not global epidemics can occur, the probability that a global epidemic occurs and the mean proportion of initial susceptibles ultimately infected by a global epidemic are all determined. The theory is specialised to (i) the households model, in which the population is partitioned into households and local contacts are chosen uniformly within an infective's household; (ii) the overlapping groups model, in which the population is partitioned in several ways, with local uniform mixing within the elements of the partitions; and (iii) the great circle model, in which individuals are equally spaced on a circle and local contacts are nearest-neighbour. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

T1  - Microbial agents associated with waterborne diseases
A1  - Leclerc H.
A1  - Schwartzbrod L.
A1  - Dei-Cas E. 
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Many classes of pathogens excreted in feces are able to initiate waterborne infections. There are bacterial pathogens, including enteric and aquatic bacteria, enteric viruses, and enteric protozoa, which are strongly resistant in the water environment and to most disinfectants. The infection dose of viral and protozoan agents is lower than bacteria, in the range of one to ten infectious units or oocysts. Waterborne outbreaks of bacterial origin (particularly typhoid fever) in the developing countries have declined dramatically from 1900s. Therefore, some early bacterial agents such as Shigella sonnei remains prevalent and new pathogens of fecal origin such as zoonotic C. jejuni and E. coli O157:H7 may contaminate pristine waters through wildlife or domestic animal feces. The common feature of these bacteria is the low inoculum (a few hundred cells) that may trigger disease. The emergence in early 1992 of serotype O139 of V. cholerae with epidemic potential in Southeast Asia suggests that other serotypes than V. cholerae O1 could also getting on epidemic. Some new pathogens include environmental bacteria that are capable of surviving and proliferating in water distribution systems. Other than specific hosts at risk, the general population is refractory to infection with ingested P. aeruginosa. The significance of Aeromonas spp. in drinking water to the occurrence of acute gastroenteritis remains a debatable point and has to be evaluated in further epidemiological studies. Legionella and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) are environmental pathogens that have found an ecologic niche in drinking and hot water supplies. Numerous studies have reported Legionnaires' disease caused by L. pneumophila occurring in residential and hospital water supplies. M. avium complex frequently causes disseminated infections in AIDS patients and drinking water has been suggested as a source of infection; in some cases the relationship has been proven. More and more numerous reports show that Helicobacter pylori DNA can be amplified from feces samples of infected patients, which strongly suggests fecal-to-oral transmission. Therefore, it is possible that H. pylori infection is waterborne, but these assumptions need to be substantiated. Giardiasis has become the most common cause of human waterborne disease in the U.S. over the last 30 years. However, as a result of the massive outbreak of water-borne cryptosporidiosis in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, affecting an estimated 403,000 persons, there is increasing interest in the epidemiology and prevention of new infection disease caused by Cryptosporidium spp. as well as monitoring water quality. The transmission of Cryptosporidium and Giardia through treated water supplies that meet water quality standards demonstrates that water treatment technologies have become inadequate, and that a negative coliform no longer guarantees that water is free from all pathogens, especially from protozoan agents. Substantial concern persists that low levels of pathogen occurrence may be responsible for the endemic transmission of enteric disease. In addition to Giardia and Cryptosporidium, some species of genera Cyclospora, Isospora, and of family Microsporidia are emerging as opportunistic pathogens and may have waterborne routes of transmission. More than 15 different groups of viruses, encompassing more than 140 distinct types can be found in the human gut. Some cause illness unrelated with the gut epithelium, such as Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and Hepatitis E virus (HEV). Numerous large outbreaks have been documented in the U.S. between 1950 and 1970, and the incidence rate has strongly declined in developing countries since the 1970s. Hepatitis E is mostly confined to tropical and subtropical areas, but recent reports indicate that it can occur at a low level in Europe. A relatively small group of viruses have been incriminated as causes of acute gastroenteritis in humans and fewer have proven to be true etiologic agents, including rotavirus, calicivirus, astrovirus, and some enteric adenovirus. These enteric viruses have infrequently been identified as the etiologic agents of waterborne disease outbreaks, because of inadequate diagnostic technology, but many outbreaks of unknown etiology currently reported are likely due to viral agents. Actually, Norwalk virus and Norwalk-like viruses are recognized as the major causes of waterborne illnesses world-wide. The global burden of infectious waterborne disease is considerable. Reported numbers highly underestimate the real incidence of waterborne diseases. The most striking concern is that enteric viruses such as caliciviruses and some protozoan agents, such as Cryptosporidium, are the best candidates to reach the highest levels of endemic transmission, because they are ubiquitous in water intended for drinking, being highly resistant to relevant environmental factors, including chemical disinfecting procedures. Other concluding concerns are the enhanced risks for the classic group of debilitated subjects (very young, old, pregnant, and immunocompromised individuals) and the basic requirement of to take specific measures aimed at reducing the risk of waterborne infection diseases in this growing, weaker population.

T1  - Foodborne infectious risks: Do we need a wide system of data collection and survey? The lessons learned from the study of infectious intestinal disease in England
A1  - Cowden J.M. 
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - In 2000, the United Kingdom Government's Food Standards Agency published "A report of the study of infectious intestinal disease in England" [1]. This report was the result of over a decade's endeavour and cost well in excess of 2 million (approximately 3.3 million euros). The study originated in 1989. In response to national epidemics of foodborne infection with Salmonella enteritidis phage type 4 and Listeria monocytogenes, the Government set up the Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (the Richmond Committee). This committee wished to know the actual level of clinical disease in the population giving rise to the laboratory reports of gastro-intestinal pathogens in national surveillance data and recommended studies to achieve this objective [2]. In addition, successors to the to Richmond Committee decided that it would be of value to collect information from both cases and controls, including documenting exposure to biologically plausible risk factors so that differences between the ill and the well could be identified. Enquiries were also made about the clinical course of disease, so that long term sequelae and socio-economic costs could be estimated. A full description of this enormous study is beyond the scope of this paper, which defends the personal view that resources might have been better spent on a less ambitious enquiry.

N2  - Objectives: The geographic epidemiology of infectious diseases can help in identifying point source outbreaks, elucidating dispersion patterns, and giving direction to control strategies. We sought to establish a geographic information system (GIS) infectious disease surveillance system at a large US military post (Fort Bragg, North Carolina) using STDs as the initial outcome for the model. Method(s): Addresses of incident cases were plotted onto digitised base maps of Fort Bragg (for on-post addresses) and surrounding Cumberland County, NC (for off-post addresses) using MAPINFO Version 5. We defined 26 geographic sectors on the installation. Active duty soldiers attending the post preventive medicine clinic were enrolled between July 1998 and June 1999. Result(s): Gonorrhoea (GC) was diagnosed in 210/2854 (7.4%) and chlamydia (CT) in 445/2860 (15.6%). African-American male soldiers were at higher risk for GC (OR = 4.6 (95% CL 3.0 to 7.2)) and chlamydia (OR = 2.0 (1.4 to 2.7)). For women, there were no ethnic differences in gonorrhoea prevalence, but chlamydia was higher in African-Americans (OR = 2.0 (1.4-2.7)). Rank and housing type were associated with gonorrhoea and chlamydia in men, but were not significant factors in women. For gonorrhoea, two geographic sectors had prevalences between 14.0%-16.5%, three between 10.3%-13.9%, three between 7.1%-10.2%, and five between 3.0%-7.1%. The geographic distribution demonstrated a core-like pattern where the highest sectors were contiguous and were sectors containing barracks housing lower enlisted grade personnel. In contrast, chlamydia prevalence was narrowly distributed. Conclusion(s): GIS based disease surveillance was easily and rapidly implemented in this setting and should be useful in developing preventive interventions.

N2  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Since 1971, CDC, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) have maintained a collaborative surveillance system for the occurrences and causes of waterborne-disease outbreaks (WBDOs).This surveillance system is the primary source of data concerning the scope and effects of waterborne diseases on persons in the United States., REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: This summary includes data regarding outbreaks occurring during January 1999-December 2000 and previously unreported outbreaks occurring in 1995 and 1997., DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: The surveillance system includes data for outbreaks associated with drinking water and recreational water. State, territorial, and local public health departments are primarily responsible for detecting and investigating WBDOs and voluntarily reporting them to CDC on a standard form. The unit of analysis for the WBDO surveillance system is an outbreak, not an individual case of a waterborne disease. Two criteria must be met for an event to be defined as a WBDO. First, > or = 2 persons must have experienced a similar illness after either ingestion of drinking water or exposure to water encountered in recreational or occupational settings. This criterion is waived for single cases of laboratory-confirmed primary amebic meningoencephalitis and for single cases of chemical poisoning if water-quality data indicate contamination by the chemical. Second, epidemiologic evidence must implicate water as the probable source of the illness., RESULTS: During 1999-2000, a total of 39 outbreaks associated with drinking water was reported by 25 states. Included among these 39 outbreaks was one outbreak that spanned 10 states. These 39 outbreaks caused illness among an estimated 2,068 persons and were linked to two deaths. The microbe or chemical that caused the outbreak was identified for 22 (56.4%) of the 39 outbreaks; 20 of the 22 identified outbreaks were associated with pathogens, and two were associated with chemical poisoning. Of the 17 outbreaks involving acute gastroenteritis of unknown etiology, one was a suspected chemical poisoning, and the remaining 16 were suspected as having an infectious cause. Twenty-eight (71.8%) of 39 outbreaks were linked to groundwater sources; 18 (64.3%) of these 28 groundwater outbreaks were associated with private or noncommunity wells that were not regulated by EPA. Fifty-nine outbreaks from 23 states were attributed to recreational water exposure and affected an estimated 2,093 persons. Thirty-six (61.0%) of the 59 were outbreaks involving gastroenteritis. The etiologic agent was identified in 30 (83.3%) of 36 outbreaks involving gastroenteritis. Twenty-two (61.1%) of 36 gastroenteritis-related outbreaks were associated with pools or interactive fountains. Four (6.8%) of the 59 recreational water outbreaks were attributed to single cases of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) caused by Naegleria fowleri. All four cases were fatal. Fifteen (25.4%) of the 59 outbreaks were associated with dermatitis; 12 (80.0%) of 15 were associated with hot tubs or pools. In addition, recreational water outbreaks of leptospirosis, Pontiac fever, and chemical keratitis, as well as two outbreaks of leptospirosis and Pontiac fever associated with occupational exposure were also reported to CDC., INTERPRETATION: The proportion of drinking water outbreaks associated with surface water increased from 11.8% during 1997-1998 to 17.9% in 1999-2000. The proportion of outbreaks (28) associated with groundwater sources increased 87% from the previous reporting period (15 outbreaks), and these outbreaks were primarily associated (60.7%) with consumption of untreated groundwater. Recreational water outbreaks involving gastroenteritis doubled (36 outbreaks) from the number of outbreaks reported in the previous reporting period (18 outbreaks). These outbreaks were most frequently associated with Cryptosporidium parvum (68.2%) in treated water venues (e.g., swimming pools or interactive fountains) and by Escherichia coli O157:H7 (21.4%) in freshwater venues. The increase in the number of outbreaks probably reflects improved surveillance and reporting at the local and state level as well as a true increase in the number of WBDOs., PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: CDC and others have used surveillance data to identify the types of water systems, their deficiencies, and the etiologic agents associated with outbreaks and evaluated current technologies for providing safe drinking water and safe recreational water. Surveillance data are used also to establish research priorities, which can lead to improved water-quality regulations. Only the groundwater systems under the influence of surface water are required to disinfect their water supplies, but EPA is developing a groundwater rule that specifies when corrective action (including disinfection) is required. CDC and EPA are conducting epidemiologic studies to assess the level of waterborne illness attributable to municipal drinking water in nonoutbreak conditions. Rules under development by EPA--the Ground Water Rule (GWR), the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (LT2ESWTR), and Stage 2 Disinfection Byproduct Rules (DBPR)--are expected to further protect the public from contaminants and disinfection byproducts in drinking water. Efforts by EPA under the Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure, and Health (BEACH) program are aimed at reducing the risks for infection attributed to ambient recreational water by strengthening beach standards and testing; providing faster laboratory test methods; predicting pollution; investing in health and methods research; and improving public access to information regarding both the quality of the water at beaches and information concerning health risks associated with swimming in polluted water. EPA's Beach Watch (available at http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/beaches) provides online information regarding water quality at U.S. beaches, local protection programs, and other beach-related programs. CDC partnered with a consortium of local and national pool associations to develop a series of health communication materials for the general public who attend treated recreational water venues and to staff who work at those venues. CDC has also developed a recreational water outbreak investigation toolkit that can be used by public health professionals. All of the CDC materials are accessible at the CDC Healthy Swimming website (http://www.cdc.gov/healthyswimming).

T1  - Projecting severe sequelae of injection-related hepatitis C virus epidemic in the UK. Part 1: Critical hepatitis C and injector data
A1  - Bird S.M.
A1  - Goldberg D.J.
A1  - Hutchinson S.J. 
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Background. Hepatitis C is transmitted by transfusion of unscreened blood, through injecting drugs, from mother-to-child and, on occasion, sexually. Transmission generally requires that the infector is hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA positive, a 'carrier'. About three-quarters of injectors who are hepatitis C antibody positive are HCV-RNA positive and so infectious to others. Incubation periods from HCV infection to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are even longer than from HIV infection to AIDS, being counted in decades; they depend on age, gender, alcohol consumption and co-infection with other viruses. We identify 25 data sources that are available, or required, for projecting the severe sequelae of the injection-related hepatitis C epidemic. Data sources. Three data sources relate to hepatitis C diagnosis: register of confirmed HCV infections (with initial of first name + soundex of surname + date of birth + gender = master index, exposure category, year of starting to inject, and region); surveys of HCV test-uptake by injectors and others; documentation of pregnancy and its outcome in HCV-infected women (injectors and others). Four data sources relate to HCV prevalence and incidence among injectors and others: anonymous testing for HCV antibodies in blood or saliva (for sentinel groups ranging from new blood donors, pregnant women, patients awaiting kidney transplantation, non-injector prisoners, health-care workers, non-injector heterosexuals attending genitourinary medicine clinics; to injectors in the community, at drug treatment centres or in prison); historical data on HCV prevalence in injectors; HCV incidence studies in injectors; and uptake of harm reduction measures-frequency of sharing and methadone substitution-by injectors. Key reporting problems in HCV incidence studies, which inhibit checks on the convenient exponential assumption for time from start of injecting to hepatitis C infection, are discussed. Nine critical data sources are identified for monitoring the late sequelae of hepatitis C carriage, its investigation and treatment: linkage surveillance, for example by master index, to identify deaths, hospitalisations or cancer registrations among confirmed HCV infections; surveys of HCV status among patients who undergo liver biopsy, are newly diagnosed with cirrhosis or are newly diagnosed with liver cancer; surveys of liver-biopsy rate in HCV-infected injectors and others; uptake and outcome of interferon + ribavirin in the treatment of hepatitis C carriers; cohort studies of HCV progression; sample surveys of genotype in HCV-infected injectors, and others; acute hepatitis B infections and uptake of hepatitis B immunisation by injectors; liver transplantation in HCV-infected patients; and hepatitis C-status and other risk factors in deaths from cirrhosis or liver cancer, to determine whether they are HCV and injector-related. Finally, nine critical data sources are identified for quantitative understanding of the underlying injector epidemic: drug misuse databases plus capture-recapture methods to assess number of injectors, drug-related deaths by region to assess injector numbers; number of HIV-infected injectors; HIV progression in injectors; overdose and other causes of death in injectors; expert opinion on injector incidence historically, plus survey information on age-distribution at initiation and duration of injector careers; injector incidence historically inferred from hepatitis C infected blood donors; age-distribution of current injectors and at initiation, as a check on the assumptions made in stochastic simulation about injector incidence and 'outcidence' from injecting historically; mortality of former injectors; and general population or other survey ratios of surviving ever-injectors to injectors in the last 5 years, last year and currently, as a check on simulations. Recommendations. We recommend a common HCV diagnosis report form to improve ascertainment of risk-factor information, especially year of starting to inject-which is a key date epidemiologically. We also recommend updated surveys of current and former injectors' HCV-test uptake; or a denominator study that registers master index and risk factor information for all HCV testees. We recommend that injector surveys ask about typical frequency of needle sharing per 4 weeks in three distinct periods: this year, last year and in the first year of injecting. We also recommend the location of stored historical samples from injectors to be tested retrospectively and anonymously for HCV antibodies. We recommend immediate attention to the uptake of, and response to, combination treatment by hepatitis C carriers who are former or recovering injectors. We recommend empirical investigation into the life-table for former injectors, and novel methods that utilise hepatitis C prevalence and drug-related deaths for estimating regional injector prevalences. Conclusions. In summary, to check future projections of injection-related severe sequelae of hepatitis C, the UK (and indeed, any country) needs to be able to count how many of its hepatocellular carcinomas were HCV-induced, and how many of its patients with cirrhosis had a history of injecting. We also need to pay heed to the number of live-born children of hepatitis C carrier mothers, and evaluate hepatitis C screening for mothers with a history of injection-drug use.

T1  - On the importance of risky behavior in the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases
A1  - Schinazi R.B. 
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - We consider a population with two types of individuals: those who engage in risky sexual behavior (the core) and those who do not (the majority). We are interested in the situation where the majority would not be able to sustain an epidemic without the presence of a core. We show that even if the core is randomly spread out in the general population and is very infectious there will be no epidemic if the proportion of individuals in the core is below a certain threshold (that depends on the infection rates). Risky behavior does put the whole population at risk but only if the behavior is widespread enough. This gives support to the idea of concentrating resources to fight sexually transmitted diseases on the core group in order to lower the proportion of individuals in the core. We show our results for two models: one with total mixing and the other with limited mixing. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  - Outbreaks of infectious disease can be confirmed by identifying clusters of DNA fingerprints among bacterial isolates from infected individuals. This procedure makes assumptions about the underlying properties of the genetic marker used for fingerprinting. In particular, it requires that each fingerprint changes sufficiently slowly within an individual that isolates from separate individuals infected by the same strain will exhibit similar or identical fingerprints. We propose a model for the probability that an individual's fingerprint will change over a given period of time. We use this model together with published data in order to estimate the fingerprint change rate for IS6110 in human tuberculosis, obtaining a value of 0.0139 changes per copy per year. Although we focus on insertion sequences (IS), our method applies to other fingerprinting techniques such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We suggest sampling intervals that produce the least error in estimates of the fingerprint change rate, as well as sample sizes that achieve specified levels of error in the estimate.

N2  - Chemical risk assessments often focus on measuring exposure as if individuals were subject only to exogenous environmental sources of risk. For infectious diseases, exposure might not only depend on exogenous sources of microbes, but also on the infection status of other individuals in the population. For example, waterborne infections from agents such as Cryptosporidium parvum and Escherichia coli: O157:H7 might be transmitted from contaminated water to humans through drinking water; from interpersonal contact; or from infected individuals to the environment, and back to other susceptible individuals. These multiple pathways and the dependency of exposure on the prevalence of infection in a population suggest that epidemiological models are required to complement standard risk assessments in order to quantify the risk of infection. This paper presents new models of infection transmission systems that are being developed for the US Environmental Protection Agency as part of a project to quantify the risk of microbial infection. The models are designed to help inform water treatment system design decisions. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

N2  - Q fever is a worldwide zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii, an obligate intracellular bacterium that lives in its host's phagocytic cells and can survive outside the cell. A variety of animals and arthropods can be infected, and the common reservoirs are cattle, sheep and goats. Animals seem rarely to develop illness from a Coxiella infection, but shed the bacteria in urine, feces, milk and especially parturition products. The bacteria has the ability to resist harsh environmental conditions, probably as the result of the formation of a spore stage, and viable C. burnetii are present in the soil for several months. The most important route whereby C. burnetii infects humans and animals is through the inhalation of contaminated aerosols. It has been estimated that C. burnetii is extremely infectious through this route as a single viable bacteria can cause disease. The highest risk of infection is for the rural population because the common reservoirs of C. burnetii result in infections due to either inhalation of the bacteria shed during the delivery season, or ingestion of raw milk. Moreover, outbreaks of Q fever can affect urban areas because of indirect exposure to infective aerosols. Nevertheless, to date most cases of human Q fever have not been diagnosed. Thus, there is need for investigation in understanding the transmission patterns and to know how it may be possible to prevent Q fever in man. © 2001 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among hospitalized human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients exposed during a nosocomial outbreak. DESIGN: Case control study. Cases were HIV-infected patients with MDR-TB due to Mycobacterium bovis (MDR-TBMb) who acquired the disease after exposure to an MDR-TBMb patient in an hospital ward. Controls were HIV-infected patients exposed to a case of MDR-TBMb in an hospital ward but who did not develop MDR-TBMb during the follow-up. RESULT(S): Nineteen cases and 31 controls were included. CD4 cell counts were significantly lower among cases. Exposure in the infectious diseases ward or exposure to the index patient were associated with development of MDR-TBMb, while exposure during a single-room hospital stay and exposure in the respiratory isolation ward were associated with non-development of MDR-TBMb. A multiple regression logistic model showed that only a CD4 cell count below 50/muL and exposure to the index patient increased the risk of developing MDR-TBMb (P < 0.05). Hospitalization in a single room seemed to protect HIV-infected patients from developing nosocomial MDR-TBMb (P = 0.052). CONCLUSION(S): Over classic risk factors, such as length of exposure or sharing a room with a case, severe immunosuppression independently increases the risk of MDR-TB transmission in the context of a nosocomial MDR-TB outbreak among HIV-infected patients. This information must be considered in the management of tuberculosis outbreaks. Patients with CD4 cell counts below 50/muL should be the principal group targeted for prevention strategies in nosocomial outbreaks.

N2  - Introduction. Injecting drug users (IDUs) represent 41.6% of the total cohort of HIV-infected patients in Ireland. Between January 1999 and December 2000, referrals to the largest tertiary centre for HIV infection in Dublin have increased dramatically. This has occurred on a background of a reduction in the overall incidence of HIV infection in Ireland between 1990 and 1998. Here we describe the changing epidemiology of HIV disease in IDUs and explore potential aetiological factors. Methods. This is a retrospective study, collecting all data relating to new HIV diagnoses occurring in IDUs, referred to the Genito Urinary Medicine and Infectious Diseases (GUIDE) clinic between 1987 and 2000. We calculated 6-month incidence rates of new HIV diagnoses in IDUs referred to the GUIDE clinic and performed a more detailed analysis of those patients diagnosed between January 1999 and December 2000, documenting age, sex, time and place of diagnosis, drug use history and primary drug of misuse, needle sharing history, attendance at a drug treatment clinic, prior HIV testing history, hepatitis B and hepatitis C status, and CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA levels at diagnosis. Results. The number of new HIV diagnoses in IDUs increased fivefold between 1995 and 2000. Moreover, 40% of patients diagnosed since then have been under 22 years old. There has also been a significant reversal of the initial male to female ratio seen in the initial epidemic of the 1980s. Conclusion. There has been a significant increase in the incidence of HIV infection in IDUs between 1995 and 2000. Similar trends have been described recently in other risk groups. The aetiology of these trends is multifactorial, and a multidisciplinary, rejuvenated approach is required to focus on improving health education to reduce both sexual and needle sharing practices.

N2  - Quantifying the transfer of Escherichia coli O157 from the environment to humans is essential for understanding outbreaks, establishing the infectious dose of the organism and proposing safeguards. We modelled the pathogen loading shed onto a field by sheep immediately prior to a scout camp where 18 scouts and two adults were infected with E. coli O157. We estimated the dose ingested (4-24 organisms) which is in agreement with the low infective dose reported previously for this organism in food outbreaks. These data closely fit a surrogate Shigella dose-response model which can be used as a basis for risk assessment. © 2001 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

T1  - The initialization and sensitivity of multigroup models for the transmission of HIV

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - We study two multigroup mathematical models of the spread of HIV. In the differential infectivity model, the infected population is divided into groups according to their infectiousness, and HIV is primarily spread by a small, highly infectious, group of superspreaders. In the staged-progression model, every infected individual goes through a series of infection stages and the virus is primarily spread by individuals in an initial highly infectious stage or in the late stages of the disease. We demonstrate the importance of choosing appropriate initial conditions, and define a new approach to distributing the initial population among the subgroups so as to minimize the artificial transients in the solutions due to unbalanced initial conditions. We demonstrate that the rate of removal in and out of a population is an important, yet often neglected, effect. We also illustrate the importance of distinguishing between the number of partners a person has and the number of contacts per partner. By assuming that people with many partners have fewer contacts per partner than people with few partners, we found that the epidemic is less sensitive to the partner acquisition rate than one might expect. However, because the probability of transmission of HIV per contact is low, the epidemic is very sensitive to the number of contacts per partner. Modeling this distinction is particularly important when estimating the impact of programs which encourage people to have fewer sexual partners. © 2001 Academic Press.

T1  - Transmission thresholds for dengue in terms of Aedes aegypti pupae per person with discussion of their utility in source reduction efforts

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - The expense and ineffectiveness of drift-based insecticide aerosols to control dengue epidemics has led to suppression strategies based on eliminating larval breeding sites. With the notable but short-lived exceptions of Cuba and Singapore, these source reduction efforts have met with little documented success; failure has chiefly been attributed to inadequate participation of the communities involved. The present work attempts to estimate transmission thresholds for dengue based on an easily- derived statistic, the standing crop of Aedes aegypti pupae per person in the environment. We have developed these thresholds for use in the assessment of risk of transmission and to provide targets for the actual degree of suppression required to prevent or eliminate transmission in source reduction programs. The notion of thresholds is based on 2 concepts: the mass action principal - the course of an epidemic is dependent on the rate of contact between susceptible hosts and infectious vectors, and threshold theory - the introduction of a few infectious individuals into a community of susceptible individuals will not give rise to an outbreak unless the density of vectors exceeds a certain critical level. We use validated transmission models to estimate thresholds as a function of levels of pre-existing antibody levels in human populations, ambient air temperatures, and size and frequency of viral introduction. Threshold levels were estimated to range between about 0.5 and 1.5 Ae. aegypti pupae per person for ambient air temperatures of 28degreeC and initial seroprevalences ranging between 0% to 67%. Surprisingly, the size of the viral introduction used in these studies, ranging between 1 and 12 infectious individuals per year, was not seen to significantly influence the magnitude of the threshold. From a control perspective, these results are not particularly encouraging. The ratio of Ae. aegypti pupae to human density has been observed in limited field studies to range between 0.3 and >60 in 25 sites in dengue-endemic or dengue-susceptible areas in the Caribbean, Central America, and Southeast Asia. If, for purposes of illustration, we assume an initial seroprevalence of 33%, the degree of suppression required to essentially eliminate the possibility of summertime transmission in Puerto Rico, Honduras, and Bangkok, Thailand was estimated to range between 10% and 83%; however in Mexico and Trinidad, reductions of >90% would be required. A clearer picture of the actual magnitude of the reductions required to eliminate the threat of transmission is provided by the ratio of the observed standing crop of Ae. aegypti pupae per person and the threshold. For example, in a site in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, the ratio of observed and threshold was 1.7, meaning roughly that about 7 of every 17 breeding containers would have to be eliminated. For Reynosa, Mexico, with a ratio of approximately 10, 9 of every 10 containers would have to be eliminated. For sites in Trinidad with ratios averaging approximately 25, the elimination of 24 of every 25 would be required. With the exceptions of Cuba and Singapore, no published reports of sustained source reduction efforts have achieved anything near these levels of reductions in breeding containers. Practical advice on the use of thresholds is provided for operational control projects.

T1  - Impact of antivirals and emergence of drug resistance: HSV-2 epidemic control
A1  - Gershengorn H.B.
A1  - Blower S.M. 
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Genital herpes, caused by herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2), affects more people worldwide than any other sexually transmitted disease (STD). Antivirals are effective in decreasing the duration of symptoms and in reducing viral shedding; however, currently antiviral usage is extremely low. Increased usage of antivirals would have a beneficial epidemic-level effect (due to the decreased transmission of drug-sensitive strains) as well as potentially a detrimental epidemic-level effect (if drug-resistant strains emerge and are transmitted). Previously, we have developed a mathematical model that we have used to predict (with a degree of uncertainty) the beneficial and the potential detrimental epidemic-level effects of increased antiviral usage. Here, we use our model to make further predictions about the impact of increasing antiviral usage. We calculate the effect, on individual patients, of antiviral usage in terms of: (1) the decrease in the average number of infectious days per year and (2) an individual's lifetime probability of acquiring permanent drug resistance. We also use our model: (1) to determine the probability of eliminating herpes by antivirals and (2) to quantify the effect of increasing antiviral usage on decreasing HSV-2 prevalence. Our results show that theoretically it would be possible to eliminate herpes epidemics by using a drug that does not cure.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Background: Mathematical modeling of herpes simplex virus type 2 transmission can provide insight into the behavior of the epidemic and the effects of control measures. Goal: To examine parameter sensitivity and assess control strategies. Study Design: The model simulates transmission in a young, sexually active, nonmonogamous population. The population is divided into compartments representing disease status (susceptible, exposed, primary infectious, asymptomatic, recurrent, vaccinated), and flows between compartments are described by differential equations. Result(s): With a base set of parameter values, the basic reproduction rate (R(0)) is 1.79, indicating that ultimate prevalence in this population will be 44%. The course of the epidemic is most sensitive to changes in behavioral parameters (time nonmonogamous and partner-change rate) and to the probability of transmission during the asymptomatic stage. Conclusion(s): In the absence of behavior change, efforts to control the epidemic must focus on vaccine development and prevention of transmission during both symptomatic and asymptomatic phases.

T1  - I. Tuberculous infection and prevention
A1  - Nambu Y.
A1  - Ogura T. 
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - In Japan, the number of tuberculosis infected patients has been increasing again, especially in the elderly. The incidence of newly registered tuberculosis patients who are over 70 years is 34%. The outbreak of tuberculosis also has been increasing, and has become a serious social problem. The elderly have a high risk of developing tuberculosis because of their immunosuppressed condition due to underlying disease and aging. Elderly active tuberculous people also confer a risk of tuberculosis infection to the non-tuberculosis infected young generation. In this symposium, we discussed about 1) the tuberculosis outbreak related to the strategy for tuberculous prevention, 2) the health examination to detect tuberculous people in the middle-aged and elderly, 3) the nosocomial transmission of tuberculosis in the hospital, 4) the nutritional damage and immunosuppressive state in elderly people related to developing active tuberculosis in latent tuberculous infection, and 5) the organ transplantation and tuberculosis focusing on living related liver transplantation. Seven cases of tuberculosis outbreak were reported in Osaka from 1989 to 1998, 2 cases in the hospital and 5 in others. Tuberculous infection index (maximum sputum Gaffky score multiplied by the number of months of persisted cough) was 8 and 15 in the hospital, 3, 0, 84, 14, and 27 in others. Three cases (43%) were observed in persons with less than 10 of this index. It is essential to evaluate carefully for tuberculosis outbreak in extraordinary examination, if the tuberculous infectious index is low. There are various immunosuppressive patients with malignancy and other underlying disease in the hospital, so we have to pay careful attention for tuberculous outbreak when there is an active tuberculous patient. In these seven cases of extraordinary examination for tuberculous epidemic, only one (0.4%) of 241 cases who received isoniazide prophylactic therapy developed active tuberculosis. Isoniazide prophylactic therapy was an important strategy for the prevention of tuberculous outbreak. (Isamu TAKAMATSU, Osaka Prefectural Habikino Hospital, Osaka) It is essential to prevent tuberculosis in the elderly to achieve tuberculosis control in public health. The health examination was an important strategy for the detection of tuberculosis in the middle-aged and elderly. The incidence of tuberculosis detection is only 9.3% by the health examination at this age. However, the health examination has well detected active tuberculosis patients in elderly (34.5%), and also 16.8% in smear positive cases with pulmonary cavitary formation. The early detection of persons with active tuberculosis is essential, and further discussion regarding cost-performance and accuracy of the health examination for tuberculosis should also be essential. Prophylactic therapy of isoniazide also might be considered for the high risk middle-aged and elderly people with underlying diseases. (Masako OMORI et al., Research Institute of Tuberculosis, Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Tokyo) The cases of nosocomial transmission of tuberculosis in the hospital have been increasing. In younger persons, the incidence of tuberculosis infected nurses and doctors is relatively higher than healthy control. The transmission of tuberculosis from elder active tuberculosis patients to healthy non-tuberculosis infected medical workers has been well recognized. It is very essential to follow guidelines for the prevention of tuberculous transmission in the hospital from the Japan Tuberculosis Society including routine tuberculin skin test for fresh medical workers. Primary education for tuberculosis in medical and nursing school is also an important strategy. Further discussion might be essential that BCG could prevent tuberculosis transmission in tuberculin skin test negative adults. (Masanori SAKATANI, National Kinki Central Hospital, Osaka) It is estimated that approximately 10% of individuals who acquire tuberculosis infection and are not given preventive therapy will develop active tuberculosis. In this development of active tuberculosis from latent tuberculosis, cellular immunity including T lymphocytes and natural killer cells plays important roles. The nutritional state and activity of cellular immunity are impaired in the elderly, so they have a greater risk to develop active tuberculosis. In the elderly, malnutrition of decreased albumin induces damage of Interleukin-12 and natural killer cell activity system. The induction of Interleukin-12 and Interferon-gamma production was decreased, by the stimulation of monocytes from elderly tuberculosis patients by BCG solution. It is essential to evaluate the mechanism of developing active tuberculosis related to nutritional damage and cellular immuno suppression. (Takahiro YONEDA et al., Nara Medical University, Nara) In organ transplantation therapy, immunosuppressive therapy consisting of tacrolimus, cyclosporine and glucocorticosteroid is administered to prevent rejection. Such therapy interferes with cellular immunity that plays an important role in tuberculosis infection. The incidence of tuberculosis infection related to organ transplantation therapy has been reported as 0.3-15%. In Japan, only 1 case of tuberculosis infection has been reported in over 500 cases of living related liver transplantation (Department of Transplantation Surgery, Kyoto University). Most living related liver transplantation involves younger patients, and faster reduction of immunosuppressive therapy might affect the lower incidence of tuberculousis. The cases of organ transplantation should increase, because especially organ transplantation is now available from brain dead donors. The precise guideline for the prevention and therapy of tuberculosis in organ transplantation is appraisal. (Tetsuya KIUCHI, Kyoto University, Kyoto) Summary, 1) Careful attention for the outbreak of tuberculosis at the extraordinary examination should be paid and prophylactic isoniazide therapy is recommended. 2) The early detection of active tuberculosis in middle-aged and elderly people is important and isoniazide prophylactic therapy for elderly persons with underlying diseases might be considered. 3) Following the guideline for the prevention of tuberculosis transmission in the hospital of the Japan Tuberculosis Society is essential to prevent tuberculosis transmission in the hospital. 4) T lymphocytes, IL-12 and INF-gamma play an important role in the process of developing active tuberculosis in previously tuberculosis infected individuals. 5) Attention to tuberculous infection in organ transplantation should be more important in the future because of the increasing number of transplanted patients.

T1  - Helicobacter pylori transmission: Can we learn lessons from transmission studies of other pathogenic microorganisms?
A1  - Mladenova Ir. 
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - The etiologic role of Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) in several GI diseases has been determined, but its route of transmission remains controversial. Fecal-oral and oral-oral routes have been proposed, but data based on the fact that H.pylori DNA have been found, has not established a pattern of transmission. In addition, H.pylori has been claimed to be cultured in samples of feces, dental plaque and saliva in a limited number of cases and often in adults who rarely become infected. Aim(s): To find and compile epidemiological models defined for transmission study of other infectious agents: fecal-oral model of Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) and Shigella (SHI) and oral-oral model for Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) transmission. Method(s): We searched on Medline through abstracts and articles from 1964 to 1997, and through reference lists before 1964. Result(s): HAV model: No transmission study with epidemiological methodology was found, only results from human experiments performed on human volunteers after World War 2 and data on risk factors from case-control studies in outbreaks were available (as food consumption and hepatitis A - O.R. 6.25; 95% Cl 1.16-30.9). SHI model: No data on studies showing a definite fecal-oral transmission were found. Only investigations into the vehicles of transmission, prevalence and incidence were performed. EBV model: The key words we used were: infectious mononucleosis (IM), transmission, epidemiology. Titles were scanned in order to eliminate the obviously irrelevant articles. We found 26 publications (2 before 1964) and 7 of them were considered valid from the point of view of epidemiological transmission. Initially, approaches were based on identification of the etiology of IM and then on the transmission of EBV. It's important to point out that after the development of a marker for the detection of EBV in oropharyngeal secretions and therefore the identificaion of salivariy glands as a major site of EBV production, studies have been able to draw a hypothesis on intrafamilial transmission and the difficulty of person-to-person transmission. After the production site of EBV was established epidemiological appproaches permitted to find oral-oral transmission, which explains the low contagiousness, the low age of infection in developing countries (89% under 2 yr), and the link with socio economic status of children (50% in the socially derived vs 2.4% in the well-to-do). Conclusion(s): The EBV model is a very interesting approach to study the H.pylori oral-oral transmission, because it is derived from multidisciplinary cooperative approach. The EBV experience emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to explaining and understanding the phenomena in general and infectious diseases in particular. The development of technology to identify viable H.pylori and the use of index cases in cohort study are mandatory to build up a transmission model for H.pylori. Therefore coworking groups of molecular biologists, clinicians and epidemiologists are indispensable for a better comprehension of H. pylori transmission.

N2  - In many cities, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 seroprevalence among drug injectors stabilizes at 30-70% for many years without secondary outbreaks that increase seroprevalence by 15% or more. The authors considered how HIV-1 incidence can remain moderate at seroprevalence levels that would give maximum incidence. Previously suggested answers include behavioral risk reduction and network saturation within high-risk subgroups. Among 767 drug injectors studied in 1991-1993, during a period of stable high seroprevalence in New York City, risk behaviors remained common, and networks were far from saturated. The authors suggest a different network-based mechanism: in stable high-prevalence situations, the relatively small sizes of subnetworks of linked seronegatives (within larger networks containing both infected and uninfected persons) may limit infectious outbreaks. Any primary infection outbreak would probably be limited to members of connected subcomponents of seronegatives, and the largest such subcomponent in the study contained only 18 members (of 415 seronegatives). Research and mathematical modeling should study conditions that may affect the size and stability of subcomponents of seronegatives. Finally, if the existence of small, connected components of seronegatives prevents secondary outbreaks, this protection may weaken, and vulnerability to new outbreaks increase, if HIV-1 seroprevalence falls. Thus, in situations of declining prevalence, prevention programs should be maintained or strengthened.

N2  - Influenza is a highly infectious disease responsible for dangerous epidemics, especially in patients at high risk. The vaccine exerts a valuable protective effect estimated up to 70 % and is still considered as the key- approach against influenza. Antiviral agents of the first generation (amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirine) have limited use because of poor tolerance and occurrence of resistance. Zanamivir or Relenza, marketed by Glaxo Wellcome, is a new virostatic drug acting as a neuraminidase inhibitor. It prevents the release of new viruses and so stop the propagation of the infection. It must be taken orally by inhalation within 48 hours after the onset of symptoms. The treatment lasts 5 days (10 mg twice daily). Its efficacy has been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials, and its tolerance is generally excellent. However, caution is recommended in patients with asthma and chronic bronchitis because of the potential risk of bronchoconstriction. No resistance has been detected until now. Zanamivir is active on all strains of influenza A and B viruses.

T1  - Trends over time in the incidence of cervical neoplasia in comparison to trends over time in human papillomavirus infection
A1  - Dillner J. 
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Introduction: The establishment of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection as a major cause of cervical neoplasia has resulted in major efforts to develop prophylactic HPV vaccines for prevention of cervical neoplasia. Cervical cancer and the other HPV-associated cancers constitute a major public health burden and eradication of the major causative infection is certainly the most appealing long-term preventive measure. Nevertheless, the effects of preventive HPV vaccination will need to be estimated and compared for (cost-) efficacy with other primary prevention and with secondary prevention programs. However, estimating the effects of preventing a causative exposure is complicated when the exposure is a transmissible infection. The spread of the epidemic is dynamic and may change over time depending e.g. on the changes in human behavior. Depending on the circumstances, prevention of an infection may have either greater or lesser effects than the prevention of a non-infectious exposure. Estimating the time trends in HPV infections and the underlying trends in the risk of cervical neoplasia is important for estimating effects of interventions. Method(s): A literature review on recent evidence on time trends in cervical neoplasia, compared with evidences on time trends in HPV infections and interactions between different types of HPV infections. Result(s): In Finland, there has between 1991 and 1995 been a 60% increase in the incidence of cervical cancer among women < 55 years of age. Trends in detection rates of cervical cancer precursor lesions are consistent with an increase in the background cervical cancer risk. From the 1960s to 1980s, there has been a major increase in HPV seroprevalences over time in the Nordic countries. Increasing trends are also seen for other sexually transmitted diseases and smoking. Several studies indicate the existence of interaction between benign and oncogenic HPV types, thus making the relationship between the incidences in HPV infections and in cervical neoplasia complex. Conclusion(s): The increase in cervical cancer is paralleled by increases in HPV infection, other STDs and smoking and changes in screening practices, all of which may have contributed. Prediction of the effect on cervical cancer incidence of changes in HPV incidences is complicated by the existence of several risk factors, the protective effect of screening and by the population dynamics of HPV infections.

N2  - Background: Lymphomas are a relatively common complication of AIDS in western countries, but little is known of the impact of the AIDS epidemic in Africa on the risk of these tumours. Objective(s): To investigate the types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) occurring in Kampala, Uganda, their association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and how their risk is modified by HIV and other variables. Method(s): A case-control study comparing NHL cases with age/sex-matched controls. Lymphoma cases included 50 histologically diagnosed adults (31 with validation and phenotyping) and 132 histologically diagnosed children (61 with validation and phenotyping). Controls were adults with cancers unrelated to HIV and children with non-infectious diseases. Result(s): Most (90%) childhood lymphomas were EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), with no association with HIV. Adult lymphoma cases were mainly BL (mostly EBV positive) or diffuse B cell lymphomas (71%). Only a weak association was found with HIV infection; a more precise estimate was obtained with the total series (OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.9-5.1) than validated/phenotyped cases (OR 2.1, 95% CI 0.3-6.7). Higher socioeconomic status adults, who travelled away from home, or had a history of sexually transmitted diseases, appeared to have a moderately increased risk of lymphoma. Conclusion(s): Childhood lymphomas were predominantly endemic BL, the risk of which was not modified by HIV. In adults, the risk associated with HIV was much lower in Uganda than in western countries, possibly because of the poor survival of immunosuppressed HIV-positive individuals. Future studies will require careful attention to subtyping of lymphomas, to investigate the possible differences between them. © 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

T1  - Tuberculosis in the elderly
A1  - Rajagopalan S.
A1  - Yoshikawa T.T. 
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Summary. Tuberculosis (TB) today remains one of the world's most lethal infectious diseases. An estimated one-third of the world's population is infected with the tubercle bacillus-Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and 7 to 8 million people develop TB disease each year (27). For purpose of clarity, TB infection (latent TB) is defined as harboring Mtb without evidence of active infection, and TB disease is active infection without Mtb based on clinical and laboratory findings. Recognizing that TB has been one of the most neglected international health problems and that the TB epidemic is rampant in many parts of the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared TB to be a global health emergency in 1993 (23). Despite the steady decline in TB cases since this time resulting from the overall implementation of more effective infection control practices, directly observed therapy (DOT), and efforts to control the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic, preventive and control strategies among other high-risk populations such as the elderly evidently remain a clinical and epidemiological challenge. The geriatric population among all ethnic groups and both genders, represent the largest reservoir of TB infection, particularly in developed nations (9). Clinical features of TB in older adults may be atypical, non-specific, and confused with concomitant age-related diseases (28). Underlying acute or chronic diseases, malnutrition, and the biological changes with aging, can disrupt integumental barriers, impair microbial clearance mechanisms, and contribute to the expected age-associated decline in cellular immune responses to infecting agents such as Mtb. Diagnosis of TB can be difficult and consequently overlooked; this treatable infection may unfortunately be recognized only at autopsy. Furthermore, therapy of TB in the elderly is challenging because of the increased incidence of adverse drug reactions. Optimal treatment of associated chronic diseases, minimization of invasive procedures, limitation of polypharmacy, and adequate nutritional support are essential for this vulnerable population. The institutionalized elderly in addition are especially at high risk for reactivation of latent TB as well as susceptible to new TB infection. This article will discuss the global epidemiology, pathogenesis and immunologic aspects, unique clinical consideration, treatment and prevention of TB, briefly inclusive of the recent published guidelines for targeted tuberculin testing and treatment of latent TB infection as it pertains to the elderly.

T1  - Environmental pollution, pesticides, and the prevention of cancer: Misconceptions
A1  - Ames B.N.
A1  - Gold L.S. 
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - The major causes of cancer are: 1) smoking, which accounts for about a third of U.S. cancer and 90% of lung cancer; 2) dietary imbalances: lack of sufficient amounts of dietary fruits and vegetables. The quarter of the population eating the fewest fruits and vegetables has double the cancer rate for most types of cancer than the quarter eating the most; 3) chronic infectious, mostly in developing countries; and 4) hormonal factors, influenced primarily by lifestyle. There is no cancer epidemic except for cancer of the lung due to smoking. Cancer mortality rates have declined by 16% since 1950 (excluding lung cancer). Regulatory policy that focuses on traces of synthetic chemicals is based on misconceptions about animal cancer tests. Recent research indicates that rodent carcinogens are not rare. Half of all chemicals tested in standard high-dose animal cancer tests, whether occurring naturally or produced synthetically, are 'carcinogens'; there are high-dose effects in rodent cancer tests that are not relevant to low-dose human exposures and which contribute to the high proportion of chemicals that test positive. The focus of regulatory policy is on synthetic chemicals, although 99.9% of the chemicals humans ingest are natural. More than 1000 chemicals have been described in coffee: 28 have been tested and 19 are rodent carcinogens. Plants in the human diet contain thousands of natural 'pesticides' produced by plants to protect themselves from insects and other predators: 63 have been tested and 35 are rodent carcinogens. There is no convincing evidence that synthetic chemical pollutants are important as a cause of human cancer. Regulations targeted to eliminate minuscule levels of synthetic chemicals are enormously expensive: the Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that environmental regulations cost society $140 billion/year. Others have estimated that the median toxic control program costs 146 times more per hypothetical life-year saved than the median medical intervention. Attempting to reduce tiny hypothetical risks has other costs as well: if reducing synthetic pesticides makes fruits and vegetables more expensive, thereby decreasing consumption, then the cancer rate will increase, especially for the poor. The prevention of cancer will come from knowledge obtained from biomedical research, education of the public, and lifestyle changes made by individuals. A reexamination of priorities in cancer prevention, both public and private, seems called for.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - The dynamics of a fatal infectious disease in a population regulated by density-dependent constraints are represented as a system of nonlinear integral equations. Survival probabilities and disease transmission coefficients may vary with the time elapsed since infection, and horizontal and vertical modes of transmission are allowed for. Criteria for the existence and stability of steady states are derived, and an example based on the dynamics of tuberculosis is presented. Finally, the relative merits of this approach, and the familiar compartmental models based on differential equations are discussed.

T1  - A random graph model for the final-size distribution of household infections
A1  - Islam M.N.
A1  - O'Shaughnessy C.D.
A1  - Smith B. 
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - In epidemiological/disease control studies, one might be interested in estimating the parameters community probability infection (CPI) and the household secondary attack rate (SAR), as introduced by Longini and Koopman. The quasi-binomial distribution I (QBD I) with parameters n, p and theta, introduced by Consul, is proposed as a model for the final-size distribution of household infections, where p (CPI) is the probability of an individual being infected from the community and theta (SAR) is the rate Of secondary transmission of infection within household. An individual can be infected either from within the household or from the community. Let X be the total number of infected members in a household of size n. Then the distribution of X is given by the QBD I with the probability mass function: P(X = x; n, p, theta) = ((x)(n))p(p + xtheta)(n-x), x = 0, 1, ..., n with 0 < p < 1, theta >= 0 such that p + ntheta < 1. The epidemic model is derived from a directed random graph. Data from influenza epidemics in Asian and American households are used to test the model and a comparison is made with the Longini-Koopman model. It is shown empirically that the QBD I is as good as the L-K model in describing the household infectious disease data, and both models provide almost identical estimates for community and household transmission parameters although they are derived from different perspectives and conditions.

T1  - Epidemiologic advances in chronic fatigue syndrome
A1  - Levine P.H. 
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Epidemiologic studies of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have been hampered by the absence of a specific diagnostic test, but with increasing interest in this disorder there has been a greater understanding of the risk factors, illness patterns, and other aspects of this multisystem disorder. Working case definitions have been developed for research purposes but they have continued to change over time and have not always been utilized precisely by various investigators. This has been a major factor in the widely varying estimates of prevalence rates, but two different studies using the same working definition and including a medical work-up have estimated the prevalence to be approximately 200/100 000. Clusters of CFS cases, which appear to be related to earlier reports of 'epidemic neuromyasthenia', have attracted considerable attention and appear to be well documented, although investigated with varying methodology and often with dissimilar case definitions. Risk factors for cases occurring in clusters and sporadically appear to be similar, the most consistent ones being female gender and the co-existence of some form of stress, either physical or psychological. The prognosis of CFS is difficult to predict, although cases occurring as part of clusters appear to have a better prognosis as a group than sporadic cases, and those with an acute onset have a better prognosis than those with gradual onset. It is highly unlikely that there is a single agent, infectious or noninfectious, that is responsible for more than a small proportion of CFS cases and, at the present time, the risk factors for developing CFS appear to lie more prominently in the host rather than the environment.

T1  - Correlation equations for endemic diseases: Externally imposed and internally generated heterogeneity
A1  - Keeling M.J. 
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - The simple susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model has provided many insights into the behaviour of a single epidemic. However, most of epidemiology is concerned with endemic infections, and for this to occur fresh susceptibles need to be generated. This is usually provided by individuals becoming susceptible soon after birth or by recruitment to cohorts at risk. This paper develops a correlation model, predicting the behaviour of connected pairs of individuals, which includes demographic processes as well as the basic epidemiology. In addition to the local spatial correlations, we consider three other forms of heterogeneity: internally generated heterogeneity in terms of stochasticity or imposed heterogeneity in terms of non-uniform vaccination or age-structure.

N2  - Understanding the epidemiology and aetiology of new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob (vCJD) disease in humans has become increasingly important given the scientific evidence linking it to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and hence the wide exposure of the population of Great Britain (GB) to potentially infectious tissue. The recent analysis undertaken to determine the risk to the population from dorsal route ganglia illustrated the danger in presenting point estimates rather than ranges of scenarios in the face of uncertainty. We present a mathematical template that relates the past pattern of the BSE epidemic in cattle to the future course of any vCJD epidemic in humans, and use extensive scenario analysis to explore the wide range of possible outcomes given the uncertainty in epidemiological determinants. We demonstrate that the average number of humans infected by one infectious bovine and the incubation period distribution are the two epidemiological factors that have the greatest impact on epidemic size and duration. Using the time-series of the BSE epidemic and the cases seen to date, we show that the minimum length of the incubation period is approximately nine years, and that at least 20% of the cases diagnosed to date were exposed prior to 1986. We also demonstrate that the current age distribution of vCJD cases can only arise if younger people were either exposed to a greater extent, more susceptible to infection, or have shorter incubation periods. Extensive scenario analyses show that given the information currently available, the very high degree of uncertainty in the future size of the epidemic will remain for the next 3-5 years. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this uncertainty is unlikely to be reduced by mass screening for late-stage infection.

T1  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Trends, epidemiology, clinical impact, and prevention
T3  - Les Staphylococcus aureus resistants la methicilline: Evolution et epidemiologie, impact clinique, prevention
A1  - Brun-Buisson C. 
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains have become endemic in hospitals in many countries. In most cases, epidemic clones emerge occasionally on the endemic background. Early institution of simple measures aimed at preventing hand-borne cross-contamination has resulted in low rates of MRSAs in a few countries of northern Europe. Although environmental contamination plays a role in some cases, colonized or infected patients are the main reservoir. Three significant problems have been identified in countries with high levels of endemicity, namely identification of the reservoir in the hospital, including detection of healthy carriers who are readmitted; notification of departments that receive healthy carriers transferred from another department in the same hospital or from another hospital; and the increasing and hard-to-control reservoir of resistant bacteria in extended-care facilities. These three problems are related to the current level of endemicity and to the risk of dissemination of resistant strains during hospital-to-hospital patient transfers. The technical responses to these problems vary with the environment and available means. They include detection of carriers in high-risk units, use of standardized reporting forms for patient transfers, and recording of the presence of MRSA in computerized medical records. Decontamination of carriers can help to prevent cross-contamination in some situations. It is of the utmost importance that all the facets of MRSA endemicity be taken into account at the level of the hospital as a whole and that all decision makers and health care providers make a commitment to reducing MRSA endemicity.

T1  - Occupational exposure to tuberculosis--OSHA. Proposed rule and notice of public hearing
A1  - Anonymous.
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is proposing a health standard, to be promulgated under section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C. 655, to control occupational exposure to tuberculosis (TB). TB is a communicable, potentially lethal disease that afflicts the most vulnerable members of our society: the poor, the sick, the aged, and the homeless. As many as 13 million U.S. adults are presently believed to be infected with TB; over time, more than 1 million of these individuals may develop active TB disease and transmit the infection to others. TB remains a major health problem with 22,813 active cases reported in the U.S. in 1995. A number of outbreaks of this disease have occurred among workers in health care settings, as well as other work settings, in recent years. To add to the seriousness of the problem, some of these outbreaks have involved the transmission of multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which are often fatal. Although it is the responsibility of the U.S. Public Health Service to address the problem of tuberculosis in the general U.S. population, OSHA is solely responsible for protecting the health of workers exposed to TB as a result of their job. OSHA estimates that more than 5 million U.S. workers are exposed to TB in the course of their work: in hospitals, homeless shelters, nursing homes, and other work settings. Because active TB is endemic in many U.S. populations, including groups in both urban and rural areas, workers who come into contact with diseased individuals are at risk of contracting the disease themselves. The risk confronting these workers as a result of their contact with TB-infected individuals may be as high as 10 times the risk to the general population. Although the number of reported cases of active TB has slowly begun to decline after a resurgence between 1985-1992, 16 states reported an increase in the number of TB cases in 1995, compared with 1994. Based on a review of the data, OSHA has preliminarily concluded that workers in hospitals, nursing homes, hospices, correctional facilities, homeless shelters, and certain other work settings are at significant risk of incurring TB infection while caring for their patients and clients or performing certain procedures. To reduce this occupational risk, OSHA is proposing a standard that would require employers to protect TB-exposed employees by means of infection prevention and control measures that have been demonstrated to be highly effective in reducing or eliminating job-related TB infections. These measures include the use of respirators when performing certain high hazard procedures on infectious individuals, procedures for the early identification and treatment of TB infection, isolation of individuals with infectious TB in rooms designed to protect those in the vicinity of the room from contact with the microorganisms causing TB, and medical follow-up for occupationally exposed workers who become infected. OSHA has preliminarily determined that the engineering, work practice, and administrative controls, respiratory protection, training, medical surveillance, and other provisions of the proposed standard are technologically and economically feasible for facilities in all affected industries.

N2  - The Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food, set up in 1989 by the Department of Health in response to national epidemics of foodborne infection, considered the available evidence and commissioned a study of infectious intestinal disease (IID) in England. Seventy practices (with 489,500) patients overall) recruited from the Medical Research Council's General Practice Research Framework between August 1993 and January 1995 collected data for one year. The practice populations were representative of practices in England by area and urban/rural location, but with fewer small and affluent practices. There were five main components. i) A population cohort of 9776 (40% of those eligible) were enrolled to estimate the incidence and aetiology of IID in the community, and a large proportion were followed up. A median of 10% of patients on practice age-sex registers had moved away or died. ii) A nested case control component based on cases ascertained in the cohort was used to identify risk factors for IID in the community. iii) In a case control component used to identify risk factors and to estimate the incidence and aetiology of IID presenting in 34 general practices 70% of the 4026 cases returned risk factor questionnaires, 75% submitted stools, and matched controls were found for 75% of cases. iv) An enumeration component was used to estimate the incidence of IID presenting to general practitioners (GPs) in 36 practices and the proportion of specimens sent routinely for microbiological examination. v) In a socioeconomic costs component used to estimate the burden of illness of IID in the community and presenting to GPs 63% of those who returned a risk factor questionnaire also returned a socioeconomic questionnaire and were representative by age, sex, and social class. Despite variable enrolment and compliance the study sample had sufficient power for the multivariable analysis. The characteristics associated with low enrollment and compliance must be considered in the interpretation of the main study results.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Patients in the industrialized world are at low risk of acquiring nosocomial infections; nevertheless, several aspects of care in the hospital or clinic can place patients at risk from infectious disease transmission. Paramount to the prevention of disease is the strict adherence to universal precautions for all patients. Tuberculosis has again emerged as a potential epidemic capable of dramatic morbidity and mortality. The World Health Organization estimated that 22.6 million people were infected with HIV and that 50 million would be infected by the year 2000. The main types of viral hepatitis are hepatitis A through G. The chance of transmitting hepatitis B virus is higher than the chance of transmitting HIV. As knowledge regarding the pathophysiology and transmission of these diseases has increased in recent years, some insight has also been gained into the problems related to transmission of diseases between individuals. This paper will discuss the transmission of tuberculosis, hepatitis and HIV as related to the dental setting and health-care workers.

T1  - Nutritional deficiency disorders and high mortality among children of the Great Andamanese tribe
A1  - Rao V.G.
A1  - Sugunan A.P.
A1  - Sehgal S.C. 
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The population of the Great Andamanese tribe of the Andaman Islands has been declining at a rapid pace. The case fatality rate during a recent outbreak of dysentery was 30.8%, all the deaths being among under-fives. As malnutrition is known to potentiate susceptibility to death due to infectious diseases, we undertook a study to determine the prevalence of malnutrition among the Great Andamanese tribe and its role in contributing to the high mortality among them due to infectious diseases. METHOD(S): The study included a diet survey, nutritional anthropometry, clinical examination, haemoglobin estimation and stool examination for intestinal parasitic infestations. Information was also collected about every pregnancy in all ever-married women in the community and deaths of their children. All 36 members of the tribe were covered. RESULT(S): The Andamanese had a poor intake of iron, vitamin A and riboflavin but a good intake of energy, protein and fats. More than 85% of the children below 6 years were under-nourished and more than 77% of children and adolescents below 19 years were stunted, wasted or both. Anaemia, vitamin A deficiency and goitre were also common among them. Almost the entire population suffered from intestinal parasitic infestations. They also have a comparatively high fertility rate and a high infant mortality rate. CONCLUSION(S): The population attributable risk for death due to malnutrition is probably one of the foremost reasons for the observed high infant mortality rate among the Great Andamanese tribe and could be one of the reasons for the continuous decline in their population.

T1  - The 72nd annual meeting educational lecture: BCG vaccines for the prevention of tuberculosis in the world
A1  - Hashimoto T. 
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - The BCG vaccines will celebrate the 100th anniversary of their discovery in a decade at the beginning of the next century since Albert Calmette and Camille Guerin had presented it before the Academic des Sciences in 1908. At present tuberculosis kills more people than any other infectious disease about 3 million people a year, including almost 300,000 children under 15, and is producing over 7,000 deaths and over 24,000 new cases every day. Therefore, WHO declared a global health emergency in 1993. More worse, recently multi-drug resistant tubercle bacilli are emerging rapidly making TB patients incurable. Under these situations we need a potent anti-tuberculosis vaccine. So first of all, we must check the century-old BCG before proceeding further. At moment, the BCG vaccines are being used worldwide in the largest quantities in the world, but still most controvercial vaccines anywhere. I would like to describe here their success and failure in the combat against the white plague. 1. The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). In 1974, when the EPI was launched by WHO, less than 5% of the world children were immunized against six infectious deseases including tuberculosis. In 1995 statistics, BCG gave the highest vaccination coverage, 87% higher than any other 5 vaccines of EPI for children. The BCG in EPI must have saved a lot of infants as the vaccine, has been proved to be most effective against the blood-born tuberculosis of child type. 2. The efficacy of BCG vaccination against tuberculosis. Results of each 10 of randomized controlled trials (RCT) and Case-control studies (CCS) showed the protective efficacy against tuberculosis as uncertain, unpredictable, as protective efficacy varied from 80% to 0%. More recently, a Meta-analysis of selected papers on BCG field trials which were so far collected. They recalculated vaccine protective effect separately for pulmonary TB and for meningeal/miliary TB in the trials. As the result, it was found that protective effect against pulmonary TB could not be calculated, but protective effect against meningeal and miliary TB was calculated as 86%, 75% respectively, in RCT and CCS, being higher than against pulmonary TB. 3. The duration of BCG efficacy against tuberculosis was confirmed to continue for 15 years after vaccination. The incidence of every form of tuberculosis decreased steeply during the 15 years following vaccination. 4. BCG revaccination. A WHO statement was issued in 1995 mentioning that there is no definitive evidence that repeated BCG vaccination confers additional protection against tuberculosis. Therefore WHO has not recommended to repeat BCG vaccination because of no scientific evidence to support this practice. Multiple BCG revaccinations are not indicated in any persons. 5. Complications with BCG. Second IUATLD study (1988) on complications induced by BCG was reviewed, especially following two points: 1-2) Regional suppurative lymphadenitis 3) Generalized lesions: fatal cases 1-2 Several African regions had experienced that the risk of outbreak of suppurative BCG lymphadenitis was low for vaccines with Glaxo and Japanese strains, but much higher for vaccines with Pasteur. This experience in nineteen eighties has led EPI to replace the Pasteur BCG vaccine with less reactogenic BCG, Japanese or Glaxo BCG to solve the outbreak of suppurative adenitis complication. 3 At moment, the only contra-indication of EPI BCG vaccination is symptomatic HIV infection (AIDS), but in the future asymptomatic HIV infection should be placed on alert, because fatal BCG generalized disseminations have already been experienced by HIV positive vaccinees although in a few cases in USA. 6. BCG seed lots for use of vaccination in the world. Nearly 10 seed lots (BCG) are being used in the world at present. However, they are more or less different each other in various characteristics: morphological, biochemical, biophysical, immunological, vaccinological and so on. None of them is the same. In the worldwide, at moment the following strains (seed lots) are being used extensively. Tokyo 172 (Japanese strain), London 1077 (Glaxo or Pasteur- Merieux strain), Copenhagen 1331 (Danish strain), are in most extensive use. The Paris 1173P2 seed lot has been used extensively until recently, however due to its strong reactogenicity, this was replaced with Pasteur-Merieux strain (Graxo 1077) of Inst. Pasteur Merieux, France. In some developing countries, Paris 1173P2 seed lot is still being used for vaccine production. In the future, both Tokyo 172 and Glaxo 1077 will be used for vaccine production most extensively, but the efficacy of both vaccines has never been compared at the same time, in the same field.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine potential risk factors for vesicular stomatitis (VS) in Colorado livestock in 1995 and evaluate VS virus (VSV) exposure of Colorado livestock in 1996. DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study of VS risk factors and seroprevalence evaluation. SAMPLE POPULATION: Premises included 52 that had VS-positive animals and 33 that did not have VS-positive animals during the 1995 epidemic, and 8 in the vicinity of premises that had VS-positive animals during the 1995 epidemic. PROCEDURE: Layout and management data for premises were collected during site visits in 1996. Signalment and management data were collected for animals from which samples were obtained, and samples were tested by serologic examination and virus isolation. The VSV seroprevalence rate was estimated for Colorado, using serum obtained for equine infectious anemia testing and from the Market Cattle Identification program in Colorado. RESULT(S): At least 1 animal was seropositive for VSV on 35 of 52 (67%) premises, and 71 of 228 (31%) animals tested were seropositive for VSV. Seroprevalence was 63 of 170 (37%) for horses and 8 of 54 (15%) for cattle. Seroprevalence of VSV in animals from non-study premises in Colorado in 1996 was estimated to be 1.1% in cattle and 0.8% in horses. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Overall VSV seroprevalence in Colorado livestock was less than seroprevalence in epidemic areas, and seroprevalence rates in epidemic areas were greater for horses than cattle. Results may indicate that some animals had subclinical VSV infection during epidemics and that animals may be exposed to VSV between epidemics.

N2  - Objectives: To conduct an Emergency Department (ED)-based treated prevalence study of heat morbidity and to estimate the rate and risk of heat morbid events for all Chicago MSA EDs (N = 95; 2.7 million visits per year). Method(s): ED patient log data were compiled from 13 randomly selected hospitals located throughout the Chicago MSA during the 2 weeks of the 1995 heat disaster and from the same 2-week period in 1994 (controls). Measurements included: age, sex, date, and time of ED service, up to three ICD-9 diagnoses, and disposition. Result(s): Heat morbidity for Chicago MSA hospital EDs was calculated at 4,224 (95% CI = 2964-5488) cases. ED heat morbidity increased significantly 5 days prior to the first heat-related death. In 1995, there was an increase in the estimated relative risk for the city = 3.85 and suburbs = 1.89 over the control year of 1994. Conclusion(s): Real time ED-based computer automated databanks should be constructed to improve public health response to infectious or noninfectious outbreaks. Rapid area-wide M and M tabulations can be used for advancing the effectiveness of community-based prevention programs, and anticipating hospital ED resource allocation.

T1  - Residential care and the elderly: The burden of infection
A1  - Garibaldi R.A. 
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Long term care facilities (LTCFs) include a variety of different types of healthcare settings, each with their own unique infectious disease problems. This report focuses on the epidemiological considerations, risk factors and types of infections that occur in elderly patients institutionalized in nursing home settings. In the US, the number of patients in nursing homes continues to grow as the population ages. Today, patients in nursing homes have more complicated medical conditions than they did five years ago as they become even more elderly and the trend continues towards shorter and shorter hospital stays in acute care facilities. The patient population in nursing homes is uniquely susceptible to infections because of the physiological changes that occur with ageing, the underlying chronic diseases of the patients and the institutional environment within which residents socialize and live. In addition, in nursing home settings, problems with infections may be more difficult to diagnose because of their subtle presentations, the presence of co-morbid illnesses which obscure the symptoms of infection and the lack of onsite diagnostic facilities. Delays in diagnosing and treating infections allow transmission to occur within the facility. Both endemic and epidemic infections occur relatively commonly in nursing homes. The incidence of endemic infections, such as catheter- associated urinary tract infections, lower respiratory infections and skin infections, is influenced by the debility level of the patients. Calculations of infection rates are influenced by the intensity of surveillance methods at each institution. Many endemic infections are unpreventable. Epidemic infections account for 10-20% of nursing home infections. These include clusters of upper or lower respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, and catheter-associated UTI's. Epidemic infections are potentially preventable with sound infection control practices. Special attention must be paid to promote universal precautions and give certain patients, such as those with known infection or colonization with Clostridium difficile, MRSA or VRE, special consideration. The potential for epidemic infections with antibiotic-resistant organisms is real. In the nursing home setting, attention must be given to develop and support strong infection control programmes that can monitor the occurrence of institutionally-acquired infections and initiate control strategies to prevent the spread of epidemic infections. Education in infection control issues and attention to employee health is essential to enable staff to care appropriately for today's nursing home population and to prepare them for the even more complicated patients who will be cared for in this type of setting in future.

N2  - Background: In our country, there are two types of infectious mumps vaccines available. In recent times, doubts have been raised regarding the overall effectiveness of these vaccines and the comparative effectiveness of the two strains (Rubini strain and Jeryl Lynn strain). In the <> Primary Care district, 245 cases were reported in 1997 (90.1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). This study is aimed at taking advantage of the outbreak of cases of mumps to evaluate affected population and comparative incidence according to type of vaccines given during childhood. Method(s): Descriptive analysis of the cases (age, territorial spread, inoculation history') and trend analysis (annual incident rates) within this health care district and the surrounding area. The overall effectiveness of the mumps vaccines. The case incidence rates among those inoculated with Rubini strain and those inoculated with Jeryl Lynn strain are also estimated. Result(s): The highest rates of incidence are found among children in the 1-4 age range. Overall effectiveness rates for these vaccines have been estimated. A significantly higher rate of infection has been found among the children inoculated with Rubini strain than those inoculated with the Jeryl Lynn strain (relative risk of 6.5 with a Confidence Interval of 95% 3.6-11.8). Conclusion(s): The effectiveness which follows from this study does not seem as good as the theoretical effectiveness anticipated for the mumps vaccines. It thus seems advisable for other case studies to be conducted by types of vaccines used. The data to be furnished by means of sero-epidemiological studies are also of major interest.

T1  - A computer model of the spread of hepatitis C virus among injecting drug users
A1  - Mather D.
A1  - Crofts N. 
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - A number of behavioural and clinical parameters influence the transmission of an infectious agent through direct contact between two individuals. The behavioural parameters encountered in such situations are also likely to exhibit an enormous amount of variability. With the spread of hepatitis C among injecting drug users, the parameters associated with injecting behaviour play an important role in the modelling of the transmission process. Computer simulation modelling is an ideal approach to deal with a large number of parameters as well as high levels of variability without excessive simplification. The simulation model presented in this paper is tested on data from a cohort of injecting drug users and the results obtained are very encouraging from a public health perspective. The model clearly indicates that the rate at which HCV spreads through a population of injecting drug users is extremely sensitive to the interaction rate and to the probability of infection through a single contact with an infective. At the same time it shows that rate of spread is not very sensitive to initial prevalence, which is very encouraging from a public health perspective.

T1  - Seasonality and infectious disease in schizophrenia: The birth hypothesis revisited
A1  - Battle Y.L.
A1  - Martin B.C.
A1  - Dorfman J.H.
A1  - Miller L.S. 
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Research literature supports the notion that more people diagnosed with schizophrenia are born during the winter months than other seasons [O'Hare A, Walsh D, Torrey F. Seasonality of schizophrenia births in Ireland. Br J Psychiatry 1980;137:74-7; Pulver AE, Stewart W, Carpenter WT, Jr., Childs B. Risk factors in schizophrenia: season of birth in Maryland, USA. Br J Psychiatry 1983;143:389-96.]. Researchers have postulated that this surge in winter-birth schizophrenia may be related to increases in viral infectious such as influenza and measles [Watson CG, Kucala T, Tilleskjor C, Jacobs L. Schizophrenic birth seasonality in relation to incidence of infectious diseases and temperature extremes. Arch Gen Psychiatry 1984;41:85-90; Mednick SA, Machon RA, Huttunen MO, Bonnett D. Adult schizophrenia following prenatal exposure to an influenza epidemic. Arch Gen Psychiatry 1988;45:189-92.]. However, data supporting significant relationships between infectious disease and schizophrenia incidence has been equivocal [Kendell R, Kemp I. Maternal influenza in the etiology of schizophrenia. Arch Gen Psychiatry 1989;46:878-82; McGrath J, Castle D. Does influenza cause schizophrenia? A five year review. Aust N Z J Psychiatry 1995;29:23-31.]. The purpose of this study was to replicate and expand previous studies by examining seasonal and infectious disease influences on schizophrenia prevalence. It was hypothesized that: (1) there would be an increase in schizophrenia prevalence during the winter months; and (2) that a significant amount of variability in schizophrenia birthrates would be accounted for by rates of influenza and measles. A Georgia Medicaid database (N=746,615) and statewide infectious disease tables were used to identify correlations. Medicaid recipients were divided into schizophrenia (n=11,736) and non-schizophrenia (n=734,879) groups. A ratio of schizophrenic recipients to non-schizophrenic recipients was calculated for each birth cohort represented by each month of the year from 1948-1965. Multiple regression analyses indicated a significant relationship between winter season and schizophrenia incidence. However, neither influenza nor measles was predictive of schizophrenia prevalence. These findings were made using one of the largest sample of schizophrenic individuals in the literature to date. Limitations of the study are discussed, including the use of seasonal and prevalence correlations without data on patient linked maternal infections. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

T1  - Cardiovascular disease in developing countries: Myths, realities, and opportunities
A1  - Pearson T.A.
A1  - Kaiser A.D. 
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - The burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially ischemic heart disease and stroke, varies remarkably between regions of the world, with declining rates in Europe, North America, and Australia/New Zealand, burgeoning epidemics in the former socialist economies and India, and relatively lower impact in developing regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. The basis for a prediction of a global CVD epidemic lies in the 'epidemiologic transition,' in which control of infectious, parasitic, and nutritional diseases allows most of the population to reach the ages in which CVD manifests itself. In fact, CVD is already the leading cause of death not only in developed countries but, as of the mid-1990s, in developing countries as well. A variety of myths have attempted to minimize the rationale for CVD control in developing countries. In reality, CVD affects men, not only the elderly, and the rich, but rather a broad spectrum of the population. Moreover, as a cause of disability it will be a world leader by 2020. Finally, there is evidence that the epidemic can be curtailed. Projections to the year 2020 predict an expansion of the CVD epidemic to the developing world, with CVD exceeding infectious and parasitic diseases in all regions except sub-Saharan Africa. These estimates, in fact, may be conservative, because several factors may allow multiplication of risk. In utero or early childhood deprivation, the use of disposable income for deleterious health behaviors (such as tobacco and a high fat/cholesterol diet), interactions between multiple coexisting risk factors, and the interaction between newly acquired health behaviors and genes may all inflate the risk to levels above those predicted. Efforts to control CVD should invest strategically in research to understand the prevalence of, and risks associated with, CVD risk factors, as well as in studies of new risk factors, measures to prevent or modify risk, and clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of these interventions. In lieu of this improved research base, a number of initiatives should go forward to prevent the dissemination of risk factors, to treat risk factors appropriately in high-risk subjects, and to develop case-management strategies shown to be both efficacious and cost effective. A global epidemic of CVD in developing countries may be inevitable unless there is a better understanding of its origins, a prediction of its magnitude, and the organization of preventive and case-management strategies early enough to control it.

N2  - Spatially explicit epidemic models explore population-level consequences of interactions between neighboring infectious and susceptible individuals. Most such models equate local and global host density, so that each individual interacts with the same number of neighbors. But many natural populations exhibit heterogeneity in local abundance. Therefore, we let host dispersion vary from uniform to clumped in a spatial epidemic with recovery. We analytically approximated the epidemic with a branching process to show how the probability of pathogen extinction could depend on the degree of host clumping. We then simulated the detailed model across a range of parameter combinations. Both approaches to the problem indicate that host spatial aggregation strongly increases the chance of pathogen extinction.

T1  - Xenotransplantation and viruses - The model of retroviruses
A1  - Schupbach J. 
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - One of the unsolved problems of xenotransplantation is the risk of transmission of infectious pathogens from the graft to the recipient, with potential effects that might be as far-reaching as in the case of the current HIV epidemic [1]. Known infectious pathogens of the donor species can be monitored and largely eliminated through the breeding of specific pathogen- free herds. There may, however, exist unknown, often latent infectious agents which do not cause disease in their natural animal host but could be pathogenic when transmitted to man. Retroviruses are an example of this category. The purpose of this review is to briefly review some relevant aspects of the biology of retroviruses and their effects on host cells, to describe the known retroviral agents of candidate xenotransplant donor species and novel highly sensitive procedures for the detection and characterisation of unknown retroviruses.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Tuberculosis is an ancient disease that remains a major global health problem. It is primarily transmitted by the respiratory route. Prolonged exposure to an infectious person is generally required for the infection to be transmitted. It is estimated that one third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The risk of developing tuberculosis following infection with M. tuberculosis has been estimated at 5-10% in a lifetime with the highest risk in the first 2 yrs after infection. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is the most potent risk factor for development of tuberculosis after infection, with an annual risk of progression to disease of 3-13%. It is estimated that 7.5 million cases of tuberculosis occurred world-wide in 1990, increasing to 8.8 million in 1995, of which 95% were in low-income countries. This number is projected to rise to 10.2 million by the year 2000. Without treatment, 50-60% of tuberculosis cases would die within a five year period. Despite the availability of an effective treatment, an estimated 3 million persons died of tuberculosis in 1995, of which 98% were in low-income countries. After decades of decline, the incidence of tuberculosis in Europe rose during the last 10 yrs. The cause of this increase varies by country, with immigration from high prevalence countries, poverty and HIV being important factors. In the former USSR, increasing notification rates are due to a combination of economic recession, malnutrition and poor living conditions. In low-income countries, the incidence of tuberculosis has risen dramatically particularly in Sub- Saharan Africa. The major causative factor is the HIV epidemic. The already high HIV-seroprevalence among tuberculosis cases is predicted to increase further in SubSaharan African countries. In southeast asian countries, the HIV seroprevalence is also on the increase. Unless effective tuberculosis programmes are implemented in all countries, the global burden of tuberculosis will continue to increase.

T1  - The impact of antimicrobial resistance on the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases
A1  - Erbelding E.
A1  - Quinn T.C. 
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - During the past 2 decades, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) have continued to escalate worldwide and nationally. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the global incidence in 1995 of new cases of selected curable STDs such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and trichomoniasis was 335 million, and the global prevalence of these diseases was 250 million. The global prevalence of active or latent infection with common chronic viral STDs such as genital herpes simplex virus, genital human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus, and more recently, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is now estimated to be in the billions of cases, because in some populations the majority of adults become infected with one or more of these pathogens. STDs are severe social, health, and economic burdens worldwide. The World Bank estimates that STDs, excluding AIDS, are the second leading cause of healthy life lost among women between the ages of 15 and 44 in the developing world. In the United States, of the top 10 most frequently reported diseases in 1995, 5 are STDs. With approximately 12 million new cases of STDs occurring annually, the rates of curable STDs in the United States are the highest in the developed world. For example, the reported incidence of gonorrhea in 1995 was 150 cases per 100,000 persons in the United States versus 3 cases per 100,000 in Sweden. A recent Institute of Medicine report emphasized that the scope and impact of the STD epidemic are underappreciated and that the STD epidemic largely is hidden from public discourse, despite the tremendous health and economic burden of STDs. The disproportionate impact of STDs on women has not been widely recognized, and adolescents and young adults are at greatest risk of acquiring STDs even though the STD prevention efforts for adolescents remained unfocused and controversial in the United States. Each year, approximately 3 million American teenagers acquire an STD in the United States. Adolescents and young adults are the age group at greatest risk of acquiring an STD for a number of reasons: they are more likely to have multiple sex partners; they may be more likely to engage in unprotected intercourse; and their partners may be at higher risk of being infected. Compared with older adult women, female adolescent and young women also are more susceptible to cervical infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia. In addition, adolescents and young people are at greater risk than older persons for substance use and other behaviors that also may increase the risk for STDs. More than 25 infectious organisms are known to be transmitted through sexual activity and may be responsible for a wide variety of clinical syndromes. Complications of STDs are more severe and occur more frequently among women than men. Several STDs, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia, are responsible for pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancies, and infertility. Human papilloma virus (HPV) infections may result in cervical cancer and several STDs have been associated with adverse outcomes of pregnancy and in perinatal transmission to the newborn infant. With the recent recognition of escalating heterosexual transmission of HIV infection, multiple studies have shown that both ulcerative STDs such as chancroid, syphilis, and genital herpes, and inflammatory STDs such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis increase the risk of HIV transmission. Early detection and treatment of STDs also have been shown to have a major impact on decreasing the sexual transmission of HIV. Consequently, a renewed interest in diagnosis and treatment of STDs as an effort of controlling their epidemic spread, including HIV infection, has been encouraged strongly by public health officials worldwide and nationally. Major advances have been made in the clinical recognition microbiologic diagnosis, and treatment of many STDs. New clinical algorithms have been developed for early detection of pelvic inflammatory disease, urethritis, cervicitis, and vaginal infections. More sensitive and specific assays also have become available for early diagnosis of specific etiologic agents. With the recent introduction of nucleic acid amplification as a diagnostic tool, it is now possible to identify early infection before clinical symptoms have developed. Finally, new antimicrobial agents have markedly advanced the effective treatment of these infections. The focus of this article is to review the development of antimicrobial resistance among several STDs and to discuss the frequency and mechanisms of resistance and recommendations for treatment of selected STDs where resistance to certain antimicrobial agents has increased. For a number of STDs such as Chlamydia trachomatis and syphilis, no evidence of antimicrobial resistance has developed over the years, although management of these diseases such as in the case of pelvic inflammatory disease or syphilis in HIV-infected individuals requires intensive treatment and follow-up to assure effectiveness of treatment. The treatment of HIV and the development of resistance to antiretroviral agents will be discussed in a separate chapter.

T1  - Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive rate: Tuberculosis as an example
A1  - Sanchez M.A.
A1  - Blower S.M. 
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - The basic reproductive rate (R(o)) is a measure of the severity of an epidemic. On the basis of replicated Latin hypercube sampling, the authors performed an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive rate of tuberculosis (TB). The uncertainty analysis allowed for the derivation of a frequency distribution for R(o) and the assessment of the relative contribution each of the three components of R(o) made when TB epidemics first arose centuries ago. (The three components of R(o) are associated with fast, slow, and relapse TB.) R(o) estimates indicated the existence of fairly severe epidemics when TB epidemics first arose. The R(o) for the susceptible persons who developed TB slowly (R(o)(slow) contributed the most to the R(o) estimates; however, the relative R(o)(slow) contribution decreased as the severity of TB epidemics increased. The sensitivity of the magnitude of R(o) to the uncertainty in estimating values of each of the input parameters was assessed. These results indicated that five of the nine input parameters' because of their estimation uncertainty, were influential in determining the magnitude of R(o). This uncertainty and sensitivity methodology provides results that can aid investigators in understanding the historical epidemiology of TB by quantifying the effect of the transmission processes involved. Additionally, this method can be applied to the R(o) of any other infectious disease to estimate the probability of an epidemic outbreak.

T1  - Stochastic epidemics: the probability of extinction of an infectious disease at the end of a major outbreak
A1  - van Herwaarden O.A. 
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - The aim of this study is to derive an asymptotic expression for the probability that an infectious disease will disappear from a population at the end of a major outbreak ('fade-out'). The study deals with a stochastic SIR-model. Local asymptotic expansions are constructed for the deterministic trajectories of the corresponding deterministic system, in particular for the deterministic trajectory starting in the saddle point. The analytical expression for the probability of extinction is derived by asymptotically solving a boundary value problem based on the Fokker-Planck equation for the stochastic system. The asymptotic results are compared with results obtained by random walk simulations.

T1  - Toxicologic risk assessment and prevention: rational and irrational approaches
T3  - Toxikologische Risikobewertung und -vermeidung: Rationalismen und Irrationalismen
A1  - Forth W. 
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - Worldwide, the management and evaluation of risks caused by chemical compounds are handled by the aid of threshold concentrations below of which one can be sure that no biological effect whatsoever can be observed. At the working place, we use the maximally tolerated concentration of the chemicals (MAK) and, in addition, the biologically tolerated concentrations (BTC) of the compounds either in blood or in other body fluids to which a male and/or female worker is exposed. These threshold concentrations should cover any toxic effect including on the one hand mere deviations of clinical chemical values without a disturbed function, i.e. symptoms of a disease as well as, on the other hand, carcinogenic, mutagenic and even allergic effects. Threshold concentrations, however, exist only for acute and chronic toxic effects and not for carcinogenic and/or mutagenic effects. In these cases, again, worldwide, the concept of minimizing the risks by the exposure is preferred since no toxicologist can be found to assure a "safe" concentration of a chemical compound that exert carcinogenic and/or mutagenic effects. With respect to these effects a proven carcinogenic and/or mutagenic effect in human beings must be discerned from a suspected effect on the basis of animal experiments or in vitro models. However, there exist also paradigms of a clearcut connection between a chemical substance or its metabolites causing carcinogenic and/or mutagenic effects in model experiments from which a clearcut suspect of similar reactions after the exposure of human beings can be drawn. In general, carcinogenic risks are overestimated in our societies. Following the data of experienced British epidemiologist most tumor diseases can be traced back to food consumption, beverages and tobacco and even sexual behavior must be ranked as cause for tumors before the rare exposure to dangerous chemicals at the working place. It is worthwhile to mention that natural toxins produced by bacteria and even infectious diseases or diseases caused by parasites are far more serious than the exposure to any man made chemical product including the Seveso poison, i.e. 2,3,7,8-TCDD, and related compounds. Vice-versa, the assumption that naturally occurring poisons could be neglected may lead to fatal experiences as for instances the outbreak of St-Anton's fire, i.e. the gangraeneous type of ergot alacaloide intoxication after having swallowed claviceps purpurea poisoned "Musli" produced by rye collected in the fields and ground in a hand mill. In Middle-Europe, since 1880, when the threshold of 0.1% claviceps purpurea in rye was established, no poisonous epidemia of St. Anton's fire was observed.

N2  - Every year there are estimated 300 000 cases of Shigella in the United States. A beta-poisson model was fit to human dose-response information ion pathogenic Shigella using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation technique. Pooled and separate data sets for the Shigella species were fit to the beta-Poisson model and 95% confidence limits and regions were calculated. Shigella dysentariae and Shigella flexneri confidence regions and limits overlapped with each other and with the pooled data set, suggesting that this model can describe Shigella in general. The pooled Shigella model as well as the upper and lower confidence limits of the three data sets showed average exposures based on the estimated U.S. caseload of pathogenic Shigella of 0.01 to 0.014 organisms (confidence limits 0.001-0.05) for a 7-day per annum period of exposure and ranges from 0.07 to 0.1 organisms (confidence limits 0.006-0.4). for a 1-day per annum period of exposure. The plausibility of the pooled dose-response model was then evaluated by comparison with two known-cruise ship outbreaks. The pooled model estimated that the two outbreaks studied could have been due to ingestion of 344 (confidence limits 72-915) Shigella cells per meal and 10.5-12 (confidence limits 1-44) Shigella cells per glass of water by passengers.

N2  - Survival from the time of AIDS diagnosis to death was determined retrospectively among Thai patients (>=13 years old) who attended a public tertiary care infectious disease hospital in a suburb of Bangkok, Thailand, from February 1987 through February 1993. An AIDS diagnosis was based on the 1987 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) definition, except Penicillium marneffei infection was included as an AIDS-defining condition. Of 329 AIDS patients, 152 (46.2%) had died. The median age at diagnosis was 31.5 years (range, 18-741 306 patients (93.0%) were males. Reported risk categories were heterosexual contact (55.2%), injecting drug use (IDU, 22.6%), male homosexual or bisexual contact (9.5%), and unidentified risk or other (12.7%). Median survival time (Kaplan-Meier) for all patients was 7.0 months; 1-year survival probability was 39.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 31.5- 46.9%). Cox's proportional hazards model showed three factors associated with survival: age, reported risk category, and presenting diagnosis. Patients aged 26 to 35 years survived longer (median survival time, 10.6 months; relative hazard [RH] = 0.61,95% CI = 0.44-0.85, referent: others), as did patients in sexual risk categories (median survival time, 7.3 months; RH = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.40+0.78, referent: IDU and other categories). A single presenting diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis was also associated with longer survival (median survival time, 19.9 months, RH = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.35- 0.86, referent: other diagnoses). AIDS patients in the early phase of the epidemic in Bangkok have much shorter survival times than patients in developed countries, in part perhaps because they are often diagnosed late in the course of HIV infection. Increased attention should be given to the early diagnosis and treatment of these patients.

N2  - A simulation model of African horse sickness in Spain was developed to investigate what factors affect the likelihood of an epidemic after the introduction of the virus. The model included 2 host species (horses and donkeys) and 1 vector species (Culicoides imicola Kieffer). Latin hypercube sampling was used for sensitivity analysis of the model, to include uncertainty in parameter estimates. In general, if an epidemic occurred most hosts were infected. The peak prevalence in midges was low, and never exceeded 3%. Midge population size, the recovery rate in horses, and the time of year when the virus was introduced were the most significant factors in determining whether or not an epidemic occurred. The uncertainty in interbloodmeal interval, removal rate (mortality and recovery) of infectious horses, midge population size, and transmission rates were significant factors in the size of the epidemic. These factors should be priorities for empirical research, and should be considered in the design of control strategies in areas at risk of virus introduction.

N2  - The pilgrimage of La Mecque is one of the main part of Islam, concerning many people. In the beginning of the century, it was a dangerous situation because of the risk of infectious diseases. These risks have dramatically decreased with the economic development of Arabie Saoudite (accommodations, drinking water, transports, health organization). More than two millions of pilgrims are welcomed each years in will sanitary conditions. This is a model of health organization.

N2  - Background. - Recent waterborne outbreaks have established Cryptosporidium as an emerging enteric pathogen, but foodborne transmission has rarely been reported. In October 1993, an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis occurred among students and staff attending a 1-day school agricultural fair in central Maine. Design. - Environmental/laboratory investigation and cohort study. Participants. - Attendees of the fair and their household members. Main Outcome Measures. - Clinical or laboratory-confirmed cryptosporidiosis. Clinical cryptosporidiosis was defined as 3 days of either diarrhea (three loose stools in a 24-hour period) or vomiting. Results. - Surveys were completed for 611 (81%) of the estimated 759 fair attendees. Among attendees who completed the survey, there were 160 (26%) primary cases. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in the stools of 50 (89%) of 56 primary and secondary case patients tested. The median incubation period was 6 days (range, 10 hours to 13 days); the median duration of illness was 6 days (range, 1 to 16 days). Eighty-four percent of primary case patients had diarrhea and 82% had vomiting. Persons drinking apple cider that was hand pressed in the afternoon were at increased risk for cryptosporidiosis (154 [54%] of 284 exposed vs six [2%] of 292 unexposed; relative risk, 26; 95% confidence interval, 12 to 59) Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in the apple cider, on the cider press, and in the stool specimen of a calf on the farm that supplied the apples. The secondary household transmission rate was 15% (53/353). Conclusions. - This is the first large cryptosporidiosis outbreak in which foodborne transmission has been documented. It underscores the need for agricultural producers to take measures to avoid contamination of foodstuffs with infectious agents common to the farm environment.

N2  - Objective: To describe an outbreak of meningococcal meningitis and the impact of rifampicin chemoprophylaxis on secondary attack rates among Aboriginal people in central Australia. Design(s): Prospective study of patients admitted to hospital between September 1987 and May 1991. Setting(s): The Alice Springs Health Region of the Northern Territory and the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Lands of South Australia, covering a population of 13228 Aboriginal people. Subjects: Patients admitted to the Alice Springs Hospital with clinical signs or autopsy findings of meningococcal disease. Rifampicin chemoprophylaxis was given to close contacts of all cases. Mencevax AC vaccine was offered to children aged 1 to 15 years in the Region. Main Outcome Measure(s): Blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with Neisseria meningitidis, or a positive result of latex agglutination testing on CSF. Positive isolates were serogrouped. Result(s): Seventy-seven cases of meningococcal disease were diagnosed in Aboriginal people over four years compared with one to two cases per year previously; of these, 60 were definite, 7 probable and 10 suspected cases. Seventy-six subjects had meningitis, of whom one also had the clinical features of meningococcal septicaemia; one other subject had positive blood cultures with a mild febrile illness without features of meningitis. The annual attack rate of meningococcal disease in the Aboriginal population was 1.6/1000. The relative risk for secondary cases was estimated to be between 0.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.92) and 0.5 (95% CI, 0.15-1.53). The annual attack rate in the non-Aboriginal population was 0.04/1000. Conclusion(s): The epidemic closely resembled those in sub-Saharan Africa, and in socioeconomically marginalised groups in developed countries. The relative risk for secondary cases was lower than generally reported, and was attributed to chemoprophylaxis for close contacts and the mass vaccination program for children. Until there are major improvements in living conditions, infectious diseases such as those transmitted by airborne droplets will continue to occur in Aboriginal communities.

N2  - HIV-infected people are infectious during the 10-20 years' incubation time as well as while suffering from AIDS. The disaster of this lentivirus epidemic is that there is a long time interval between source (virus inoculation) and result (manifestation of AIDS). The registered AIDS cases represent only the tip of a mountain. By now, more than half of a million AIDS cases are reported to the WHO, but the real number is assumed to be double. In Europe about 80000 AIDS patients are registered. In most of the industrialized countries where now a certain stagnation among the typical risk groups of homosexuals and drug addicts is visible, now one can see a slow, steady increase among the heterosexual population. In Europe at this time 18% of the newly diagnosed AIDS cases are women. The number of HIV-infected persons reflects the number of AIDS patients to be expected for the next years. In Germany 1 per thousand of the population are infected (55000-90000 persons), in Switzerland 2-4 per thousand (20000-30000 persons). Worldwide 12-13 millions of people are estimated to be HIV-infected, and projections for the year 2000 expect 38-110 millions. - More than 50% of AIDS patients have ocular manifestations.

N2  - Objectives: In an epidemic: to measure the incidence and risk of complications of influenza; to determine the effect of pre-existing disease on complications; to estimate vaccine uptake and efficacy. Design(s): Case-control study. Setting(s): Primary care: two group practices. Subjects: 342 of the 395 cases of clinically diagnosed influenza reported to the general practice surveillance of infectious diseases scheme of the Public Health Laboratory Service during the 1989 epidemic, and 342 age and sex matched controls. Intervention(s): Examination of records. Main Outcome Measure(s): Documented recognised complications; hospital admission; previous vaccination. Result(s): Of 15 recognised complications, bronchitis was the commonest (rate 190.1/1000 cases) and significantly commoner in cases (summary odds ratio 9.7) after adjusting for higher consultation rates (mean 6.1 per annum v 4.2 among controls; p < 0.0001). No deaths were recorded. The risk of bronchitis complicating influenza was higher in patients with pre-existing illnesses regarded as an indication for vaccination (odds ratio 3.3; p < 0.0001). Observed vaccination efficacy in those with pre-existing illnesses and in elderly subjects was high (63% and 77% respectively) but uptake was low (4.5% and 6.1% respectively). Conclusion(s): Bronchitis complicates about one fifth of all cases of influenza presenting to general practitioners. Patients with pre-existing illnesses regarded as an indication for vaccination are particularly at risk. Vaccine uptake is extremely low, precluding an unequivocal demonstration of a protective effect.

N2  - The safety and immunogenicity of vaccines are demonstrated before they are made available to doctors and the public. However, the protective activity against the disease for which a vaccine was ed can only be accurately measured in field trials. This involves its large-scale use in the target population. Epidemiology is the best approach to assess the results. This approach is based on the comparison of the incidence of the disease among vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals. Three techniques can be used to estimate vaccine efficacy in a population: screening methods; cohort studies; and case control studies. These methods are most often used during epidemics, and this article discusses their application in this context. The validity of these methods depends on three criteria: - that the administration of the vaccine to individuals in the population is random; - that contacts between individuals in the population is random, and that vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals have the same probability of encountering the infectious agent; - that the population has equal susceptibility to the infection (other than the effect of the vaccine). If these conditions are not respected, the results of the analyses can be biased. The method involving calculation of the secondary attack rate in the families of index cases is the method where these conditions are most likely to be fulfilled.

Y1  - 1995//
N2  - A study is made of a two-dimensional stochastic system that models the spread of an infectious disease in a population. An asymptotic expression is derived for the probability that a major outbreak of the disease will occur in case the number of infectives is small. For the case that a major outbreak has occurred, an asymptotic approximation is derived for the expected time that the disease is in the population. The analytical expressions are obtained by asymptotically solving Dirichlet problems based on the Fokker-Planck equation for the stochastic system. Results of numerical calculations for the analytical expressions are compared with simulation results.

N2  - Background. Consultation waiting rooms and similar medical settings, either public or private, are places where children have higher probability of acquiring some infectious diseases, especially during outbreaks. Methods. During a measles outbreak which occurred in Lisbon in 1989 a case-control study was carried out in a major paediatric hospital to estimate the risk of measles infection associated with the exposure in medical settings. The statistical analysis was performed with data matched on age, using conditional logistic regression, to reach a multivariate model which explains the risk in the presence of the main variables of interest. Results. The crude odds ratio (OR), based upon 72 cases and 216 controls, in children younger than 12 years, was 4.1 (P < 0.001). Hospital emergency settings had an OR of 4.9 (P < 0.001) and private physicians' offices an OR of 1.4 (P = 0.689). Non-whites showed a 2.4-fold increase in the crude probability of getting measles, although this was not statistically significant (P = 0.118). Children who had a recent contact with cases of measles had an OR of 14.7 (P = 0.005). Immunization against measles was an important protective factor (OR = 0.1; P < 0.001), as was attendance at kindergartens or wet nurses, although less significant (OR = 0.4; P = 0.051). Conclusions. This study supports the need for children to avoid unnecessary exposure in medical settings during measles outbreaks, especially if those settings are crowded and result in long waiting periods before a consultation.

T1  - Aetiology of Crohn's disease: Current data

N2  - Both genetic and environmental factors appear to play an aetiologic role in Crohn's disease. The hypothesis of genetic susceptibility is based on the frequency of familial forms (6-33%) and higher relative risk in first degree relatives (x10 to x21). Three genetic segregation analyses have defined a genetic model favouring autosomal recessive transmission and incomplete penetration. The frequency of the deleterious allele would be 0.01 in the general population. One-third of all patients would be homozygous. To date, no genetic marker has been found for Crohn's disease although in one study, molecular biology techniques revealed a significant association between the HLA-DR1, DQW5 genotypes, and the association DR1/DQW5, and Crohn's disease. There are also many arguments in favour of an environmental cause, including: increased incidence since the Second World War, a north-south incidence gradient (established in the US and probable in Europe), predominance in urban areas. In addition, 21 conjugal forms were recently reported in the US, including 14 which appeared after marriage. We have also observed 10 conjugal forms in a limited area in northern France and in Belgium. Smoking has also been shown to have a detrimental effect, perhaps via modifications in the microcirulation of the intestinal wall. Despite contradictory results, oestrogen-progesterone treatment does not appear to increase the risk of Crohn's disease and there is no convincing evidence that any particular food could be incriminated. In contradiction with a widely believed myth, there is no evidence showing that psychiatric factors have an effect on appearance or aggravation of the disease. Perinatal infection has however been recently shown to affect incidence and subjects born during periods of flu epidemics have a higher relative risk. Still other studies have emphasized the dual role of genetic/environmental factors. Based on current knowledge, the sequence leading to the appearance of Crohn's disease would include one or more perinatal event(s) such as viral infection acting on a genetically susceptible subject and leading to modified immune response in a vulnerable system (perinatal period). Later in life an aggression (environment) would lead to inappropriate immune response. Current research is directed towards identifying infectious agents capable of triggering the disease and on markers of genetic susceptibility.

T1  - Modelling the female-to-male per-act HIV transmission probability in an emerging epidemic in Asia
A1  - Satten G.A.

A1  - Longini Jr. I.M. 
Y1  - 1994//
N2  - The per-sexual-act probability of transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) from an infected person to a susceptible sex partner can be determined from a simple model if the number of contacts each study participant has with infected partners is known. The unusual epidemiologic situation in the emerging HIV epidemic in Thailand allowed this quantity to be estimated from a cross-sectional study of young men conscripted into the Thai military in 1991. Although the simple model does not fit the data, an errors-in-variables approach provides a model with adequate fit. Other sources of lack of fit, including heterogeneity of the transmission probability, are discussed. With adjustment for measurement error, the per-act probability is estimated to be 0.056, an order of magnitude higher than similar estimates in North America. Because data indicate that recently infected persons may be more infectious, and because extensive HIV transmission in Thailand began in 1988, this difference may be due, in part, to a higher proportion of recently infected individuals in the emerging Thai epidemic from 1988 to 1991.

N2  - Vaccine efficacy, the effectiveness of a vaccination programme and the fraction of a population that would be necessary to vaccinate in order to prevent a measles outbreak are studied in a population having a vaccination programme. A dynamic model for acute, directly transmitted diseases was applied, based on the rate of transmission, namely, the probability that the infectious agent is transmitted from an infected to a susceptible person within a short space of time. We carried out a population-based study where we observed the final attack rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated people for a measles outbreak. In this population, the vaccination programme is responsible for a reduction of: 82.41% of all cases in the non-vaccinated sector; 98.45% of the average risk of disease among the vaccinated; and 97.29% of all cases among the population as a whole. Under these conditions there is the possibility of disease outbreaks arising, outbreaks which could be prevented if the percentage of the vaccinated population exceeded 95%.

T1  - The estimation of the basic reproduction number for infectious diseases
A1  - Dietz K. 
Y1  - 1993//
N2  - The basic reproduction number R0 is the number of secondary cases which one case would produce in a completely susceptible population. It depends on the duration of the infectious period, the probability of infecting a susceptible individual during one contact, and the number of new susceptible individuals contacted per unit of time. Therefore R0 may vary considerably for different infectious diseases but also for the same disease in different populations. The key threshold result of epidemic theory associates the outbreaks of epidemics and the persistence of endemic levels with basic reproduction numbers greater than one. Because the magnitude of R0 allows one to determine the amount of effort which is necessary either to prevent an epidemic or to eliminate an infection from a population, it is crucial to estimate R0 for a given disease in a particular population. The present paper gives a survey about the various estimation methods available.

Y1  - 1993//
N2  - By using routinely collected data and results from research studies at the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH), Nairobi, we have begun to determine the scale of the increase in resource utilisation and treatment costs for tuberculosis control services caused by the HIV epidemic. New cases of tuberculosis registered annually at the IDH rose 61%, from 447 in 1985 to 720 in 1990. HIV seroprevalence among patients with tuberculosis rose from 7.5% in 1986 to 42% in 1990. The inpatient mortality rate rose from 8.4% in 1985 to 16.8% in 1989, but fell to 13.5% in 1990. HIV-positive patients were admitted to hospital on 2 or more occasions more often than HIV-negative patients (Relative risk (RR) = 2.46, 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.1-5.7), but average duration of admission was similar for the 2 groups. Significantly more HIV-positive patients were prescribed antibiotics, antifungal agents, antidiarrhoeal agents, analgesics and corticosteriods than HIV-negative patients. Microbiological investigations, apart from those for tuberculosis, were performed more commonly among HIV-positive patients (RR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-4.2). Using this data, the average cost of ideal drug therapy, including antituberculosis drugs and treatment for intercurrent infections and other complications, was estimated using 1992 prices (ECHO, Coulsdon Surrey, UR). The costs were US$16.62 and US$32.94 for HIV-negative patients using 'standard' therapy (2STH/10TH) and short course therapy (2SHRZ/6TH) respectively, and US$41.18 for HIV-positive patients using a short-course regimen without thiacetazone (2EHRZ/6EH). The HIV epidemic is causing both an increase in the numbers of patients requiring treatment and an increase in the average cost of treatment per patients. This latter increase is almost entirely due to the cost of treating intercurrent infections other than tuberculosis.

T1  - A leap of faith. What can we do to curtail intrainstitutional transmission of tuberculosis?
A1  - Iseman M.D. 
Y1  - 1992//
N2  - Large-scale, epidemic transmission of tuberculosis to patients, nonprofessional staff, nurses, and physicians has been documented recently in hospitals, clinics, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) residencies, and correctional facilities. Prominent factors in these outbreaks have included human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and AIDS, delayed diagnosis of tuberculosis, multidrug-resistant strains of tuberculosis that resulted in protracted shedding of mycobacteria, and ventilation patterns in buildings that resulted in the accumulation of infectious particles. Multiple deaths from tuberculosis have resulted. Various strategies, including vaccines, masks, augmented ventilation, air filters, and ultraviolet irradiation have been proposed to control this situation. Although no well- controlled studies exist to document the utility of any of these modalities, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation seems both the best theoretical model and the most practical tactic. Ultraviolet systems should be widely deployed throughout high-risk institutions.

Y1  - 1990//
N2  - In industrialized countries HIV-1-seropositive mothers who are nursing infants are advised to use artificial feeds, whilst HIV-infected women in the developing world are recommended to breast-feed. Current evidence is insufficient even to estimate the attributable risk associated with breast-feeding. There is a possibility that the policy promoted in industrialized societies will eventually become established in urban and peri-urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa. This may be defensible for some elite urban mothers providing safe artificial feeding. However, calculations of the consequence of any population-level change to bottle-feeding indicate that it would result in more deaths from infectious causes, substantially adding to the child deaths directly attributable to HIV-1 infection. These data demonstrate that there is a clear need for policy-makers and health care workers to undertake further promotion of breast-feeding despite the AIDS epidemic.

N2  - Feedstuffs and foodstuffs of animal origin have to make allowances for measures of animal hygiene as well as measures which serve for protection of human health. A fundamental task of animal hygiene is to recognize and avert the infectious risk which follow from feedstuffs contaminated by residual products as well as Salmonella contamined feedstuffs well-timed. The behaviour of reproduction and survival of Salmonella in environmental media and on plants is determined by endogenous factors of the microorganisms themselves and by environmental conditions on the media. It is entered into the achieved level of knowledge of survival behaviour of Salmonella in environmental media and the treatment processes and storage technologies for residual products which usually are estimated in agriculture. In opinion of the authors, new technological procedures are essential for an effective hygienic treatment of residual products for the successfully prevention of animal epidemics and their fighting.

N2  - Due to the multitude of invasive procedures of today's intensive care medicine, infections from central venous catheters have gained increasing attention. The incidence of bacteremias arising from such devices ranges from < 0.1 to 0.6 cases per 100 catheter-days. Factors influencing the incidence of catheter-associated infections are related to patient characteristics as well as the purpose and material of the catheter. Silicone catheters seem to carry a lower risk of infection than common polytetrafluorethylene catheters. The most frequently isolated bacteria in catheter-associated infections are coagulase-negative and coagulase-positive staphylococci, enterococci, and pseudomonas species. Septicemias due to Candida albicans frequently complicate the course of immune-compromised patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPE). Catheter-associated bacteremias (CAB) can arise from the contaminated hub, from which pathogens migrate intraluminally to the blood stream. When the catheter entry site is infected, bacteria may reach the blood via the extraluminal route and cause septicemia. Endemic outbreaks of CAB often originate from contaminated infusion fluids. As the clinical presentation of 'catheter infections' is often uncharacteristic and insidious, a definite diagnosis depends on bacteriological examination of the catheter. Quantitative and semiquantitative culture techniques of the catheter tip help to distinguish colonization from contamination by numbers of colony-forming units per milliliter culture medium. Preliminary results can be obtained by simple Gram or acridine-orange staining of the catheter tip. The most important prophylactic measures to prevent CAB are strictly aseptic conditions when catheters are placed and meticulous care thereafter, preferably by specially trained nurses or 'TPE teams'. Other preventive measures are subcutaneous tunnelling of the catheter, antibiotic or antiseptic ointments at the insertion site, and filters to prevent bacteria in the infusion fluid from reaching the blood stream. Once a catheter is found to be infected, it should be removed immediately regardless of the fact that some authors report successful antibiotic treatment with catheters left in place. Due to the expected pattern of resistance of Staphylococcus epidermidis, vancomycin should be considered the drug of choice if calculated antibiotic therapy is initiated.

T1  - Hepatitis B infection in the United States. Recent trends and future strategies for control

N2  - Viral hepatitis is the second most common reportable infectious disease in the United States, with hepatitis B accounting for about 45 percent of cases. Although approximately 25,000 cases of hepatitis B are reported to the Centers for Disease Control each year, it is estimated that there are actually about 300,000 annual infections (up from 200,000 in the early 1980s). This increase has occurred despite the availability of a safe and effective hepatitis B vaccine since 1982. Hepatitis B occurs primarily in young adults because of lifestyle or occupationally related exposure. Reported cases in homosexual men have decreased, probably because of changes in behavior related to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic. Cases due to heterosexual transmission and intravenous drug use are increasing. The proportion of cases in health care workers has decreased, possibly because 30 to 40 percent of high-risk health care workers have been vaccinated. Because of the increase in hepatitis B infection, the strategy of controlling this disease by vaccinating high-risk groups must be reconsidered. Alternative strategies include selective or universal immunization of infants or adolescents. Although integrating hepatitis B vaccine into infant immunization programs takes advantage of the existing system, it would not lead to measureable disease reduction for two decades. Immunizing adolescents would more rapidly reduce the incidence of hepatitis B, but currently no structured health care setting reaches them.

N2  - A discrete-time model is devised for the per-time-unit distribution of infectious disease cases in a sample of households. Using the time at which an individual is identified (e.g., when illness symptoms appear) as a marker for being infected, the probabilities of becoming infected from the community or from a single infectious household member are estimated for various risk factor levels. Maximum likelihood procedures for estimating the model parameters are given. An individual may be classified with regard to level of susceptibility and level of infectiousness. The model is fitted to a combination of symptom and viral culture data from a rhinovirus epidemic in Tecumseh, Michigan. In general, it is observed that decreasing risk of infection is associated with increasing age.

T1  - Blood-borne infections associated with transfusion
A1  - Ulrich P.P.
A1  - Vyas G.N. 
Y1  - 1992//
N2  - The epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the realization that transmission of human immunodeficiency virus is caused by homologous blood transfusion have changed the way physicians and their patients view the safety of hemotherapy. Considering that nearly four million patients receive the lifesaving benefits of blood transfusions every year in the United States, we need to recognize and reduce the inherent biological complications of this therapy. Currently, a major concern is the transmission of blood-borne infectious agents and the establishment of persistent infection in transfusion recipients, which is apparently facilitated by suppression of the recipient's hematopoietic and immune systems. Education of blood donors, patients, and attending physicians regarding infectious complications of transfusion is essential and remains the most effective procedure for making rational decisions. Before giving blood transfusions, astute physicians should calculate a risk/benefit ratio and communicate it to the patient or family. Potential recipients of transfusions can be assured that the blood supply is safer now than at any time in the past, although there is still a very small risk for the transmission of infectious agents that cause chronic diseases, such as hepatitis, AIDS, neuropathies, and leukemias. It is essential that everyone understands that the goal of a zero- risk blood supply is not attainable. Recent developments in molecular biology and biotechnology, however, provide opportunities for further reduction of infectious complications of blood transfusions.

T1  - Interpretation and estimation of vaccine efficacy under heterogeneity
A1  - Halloran M.E.
A1  - Haber M.
A1  - Longini Jr. I.M. 
Y1  - 1992//
N2  - Interpretation and estimation of vaccine efficacy is complicated when the vaccine effect is heterogeneous across vaccinated strata. If a person has a certain susceptibility, or probability of becoming infected conditional on a specified exposure to infection, then one effect of a vaccine would be to reduce that susceptibility, possibly to zero. Vaccine efficacy is a function of the relative susceptibilities in the vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. Under heterogeneity of vaccine effect, a general expression for a summary vaccine efficacy parameter is a function of the vaccine efficacy in the different vaccinated strata weighted by the fraction of the vaccinated subpopulations in each stratum. Interpretation and estimability of the summary vaccine efficacy parameter depends on whether the strata are identifiable, and whether the heterogeneity is host- or vaccine-related. Bounds are derived for the summary vaccine efficacy when the strata are not identifiable for the case of an outbreak of an acute infectious disease. The upper bound assumes that everyone is equally affected by the vaccine, and the lower bound assumes that some are completely protected while others have no protection. The biologic interpretation of the two bounds is different.

T1  - Modeling the AIDS epidemic in Mexico City

A1  - Awerbuch T. 
Y1  - 1991//
N2  - To study the future course of the AIDS epidemic in Mexico City, we use an open compartmental model to forecast new AIDS cases among homosexual and bisexual males and among heterosexual males and females. For each group three compartments are defined: uninfected persons, infected but asymptomatic persons, and persons diagnosed with AIDS. It is assumed that the AIDS epidemic will follow the propagation of infectious disease model, where spread of infection is proportional to the product of the number of healthy persons and the number of infected ones. The compartmental model is represented by a system of nonlinear differential equations describing the rate of change in the number of persons in each compartment. The impact of preventive measures is explored by decreasing the probability of HIV transmission, which is one of the model parameters representing behavioral patterns. By April 1989, 491 AIDS cases had been reported in Mexico City and classified as sexually related. Our model predicts that the AIDS incidence will continue to rise in Mexico City for the foreseeable future and will spread among the heterosexual population. Decreasing the transmission probability by 10% in all groups (through education programs) will result in a decrease of 18.1% in the number of accumulated cases over a 5-year period. A 20% decrease would prevent more than 31% of the cases. We conclude that mathematical models can be valuable in predicting the spread of the AIDS epidemic and the impact of behavioral change on its spread.

T1  - Adolescent smoking and drinking: Are they ''epidemics''?
A1  - Rowe D.C.
A1  - Rodgers J.L. 
Y1  - 1991//
N2  - During adolescence, cumulative prevalences of ever using alcohol and ever smoking a cigarette increase systematically and dramatically. We applied a statistical theory of the transmission of epidemic infectious disease to model life-time prevalences of smoking and drinking. Alcohol use prevalences fit closely to a logistic curve used to model an epidemic process that assumed adolescents have random contacts with one another each year. An ''adequate contact'' will convert a nondrinker to drinking status if he/she is contacted; drinkers average .48 adequate contacts per year. Smoking prevalences were fit assuming both that the entire population was ''at risk'' and that some individuals were ''immune'': the mean contact parameter was .28 for smoking if no immune class was assumed and .77 if an immune class was assumed. Extensions of these epidemic process models could include individual differences in contact rates and transitions among several smoking or drinking statuses (e.g., non-user, experimenter, regular user and recovered user).

T1  - Measures of the effects of vaccination in a randomly mixing population
A1  - Haber M.
A1  - Longini Jr. I.M.
A1  - Halloran E. 
Y1  - 1991//
N2  - Vaccine efficacy in the field is often derived from the relative attack rates in the vaccinated and unvaccinated after an outbreak. In this paper, vaccine efficacy is defined in terms of the probability that the infectious agent is transmitted from an infected to a susceptible person, and a method for estimating it from the usual attack rate data is given. We explore two mechanisms of vaccine action defined by Smith et al. but include an underlying dynamic epidemic model of an acute directly transmitted disease. We show analytically that under the model in which the vaccine mechanism reduces the probability of infection given a certain exposure, vaccine efficacy based on the relative attack rates underestimates the protective effect of the vaccine based on the relative transmission probabilities. Under the other model in which the vaccine mechanism offers complete protection to a certain proportion of those vaccinated, and no protection to the other vaccinated proportion, the vaccine efficacy based on the relative attack rates will equal that based on the transmission probabilities. Parameters for the effectiveness of a vaccination programme are defined in terms of the direct and indirect benefit to a single person as well as the total and average benefit to the entire population, and derived from the dynamic model for an outbreak of an acute directly transmitted disease. These effects can also be estimated without an actual separate unvaccinated population, independent of assumptions about the vaccine mechanism. The variation of these measures as functions of the fraction of vaccinated people in the population is explored numerically.

N2  - A stochastic infectious disease model was developed by Ball (1986, Advances in Applied Probability 18, 289-310) in which the distribution of the length of the infectious period is allowed to have any distribution that can be described by its Laplace transform. We extend this model such that the infection can be transmitted within the population or from an unspecified source outside the population. Also, discrete heterogeneity in the population can be modeled to incorporate variable susceptibility, variable infectivity, and/or mixing behaviors. The model is fitted to serologic data from two influenza epidemics in Tecumseh, Michigan, using maximum likelihood estimation procedures. The estimates show a clustering pattern by age groups.

N2  - A good measure of the efficacy of vaccines should be based on an index that standardizes the exposure to infection of those who have been immunized and those who have not. In addition, the measure should not be influenced by indirect effects. In the case of outbreaks directly transmitted agents that cause acute infections diseases, the household secondary rates of attack are the best indicator of vaccine efficacy provided that the data are collected at the household level. If the data are not collected in this manner, the best indicator will be the estimated probability of transmission, even though this estimator and its meaning less obvious than the secondary attack of rate. Other strategies to estimate the efficacy of an immunization are more appropriate for situations that are more complex than outbreaks caused by acute infectious agents.

N2  - In an experimental model designed to simulate actual clinical situations, the risk period of adenovirus type 19 (AdV-19) and enterovirus 70 (EV-70) transmission by contaminated instruments has been investigated, as well as the effective methods of disinfection against these viruses. No EV-70 could be detected 6 hours after inoculation on applanation tips contaminated with viruses and naturally dried, indicating that drying the instruments and keeping them in a moisture-free environment is a convenient disinfection procedure against EV-70. In contrast, AdV-19 maintained its initial infectious level for 11 days on contaminated and subsequently dried tips. Both viruses when placed in eyedrop solutions at room temperature sustained their infectivity for more than 20 days. It was found that heating at 90degreeC for 5 seconds is the most simple and effective disinfection against AdV-19 and EV-70. AdV-19 was about 60 times more resistant to ultraviolet irradiation than EV-70.

N2  - The authors have verified morbidity antecedents in the medical files of 18.5% of the cohort of 47,354 students registered in classes I-VIII in the year 1988-1989 in the III-rd Sector of Bucharest. On the basis of simple hypotheses concerning the post-infectious anti-rubeola immunity, and the post-vaccinal immunity respectively an index was estimated of the anti-rubeola collective immunity of 89.1% a value associated to the risk of transmission of the rubeola infection in this cohort. These observations have permitted the authors to suggest anti-rubeola vaccination of students without documented evidence of anti-rubeola immunity on the one hand, immediately in all the classes (I--VIII) of the present scholar year, and, on the other hand, to vaccinate all the students in the first class, yearly, as an additional measure in the present control anti-epidemic strategy of rubeola.

N2  - Parasitological and entomological parameters of malaria transmission were monitored for 17 months in 3.625 residents in a Plasmodium vivax malaria endemic region in Southern Sri Lanka; the study area consisted of 7 contiguous villages where routine national malaria operations were being conducted. Malaria was monitored in every resident; fever patients were screened and 4 periodical mass blood surveys were conducted. An annual malaria incidence rate of 23.1% was reported during the period: 9.3% was due to P. vivax and 13.8% was due to P. falciparum; there had been a recent epidemic of the latter in this region, whereas the P. falciparum incidence rat in the previous 10 years had been negligible. There was a wide seasonal fluctuation in the malaria incidence, with the peak incidence closely following the monsoon rains. The prevalence of malaria due to both species detected at the 4 mass blood surveys ranged from 0.98% (at low transmission) to 2.35% (at peak transmission periods). Adults and children developed acute clinical manifestations of malaria. Entomological measurements confirmed a low degree of endemicity with estimated inoculation rates of 0.0029 and 0.0109 (infectious bites/man/night) for P. vivax and P. falciparum, respectively. Several anopheline species contributed to the transmission, and the overall man biting rates (MBR) showed a marked seasonal variation. Malaria at Kataragama, typical of endemic areas of Sri Lanka, thus presents characteristics of 'unstable' transmission. Malaria was clustered in the population. There was a low clinical tolerance to P. falciparum malaria, to which most had only recently been at risk, compared to P. vivax, to which most had had a life-long exposure.

N2  - In an urban area of Guinea-Bissau, 71 children exposed to measles before age 6 months had a mortality risk of 34% (95% confidence interval (CI) 24-47) between 6 and 60 months of age. The mortality risk for the 205 other children of the same birth cohort who had not been exposed to or developed measles was 11% (95% CI 9-15), a significant difference compared with exposed children. With a version of the Cox regression model, maternal education was found to be the only background factor with a significant effect on mortality. When background factors were controlled for, the mortality of children exposed to measles was significantly higher than that of controls in each of the age intervals 6-11, 12-33, and 24-35 months. For the large subgroup of children of mothers without any formal education, exposed children had 5.7 times (95% CI 2.7-12.0) higher mortality than did the control children in the age interval 6-35 months. Diarrhea deaths were particularly common among exposed children. Of 22 children who had been exposed before age 6 months during a subsequent epidemic and had a blood test taken, there was a significantly higher mortality risk (27%) between 6 months and 5 years than in the 26 controls who had a blood test (0%). Children who had elevated antibody titers to measles after exposure had a particularly high mortality compared with controls. These results suggest that later childhood mortality may be related to infectious experiences during the first months of life. The possible long-term health consequences of exposure to measles virus should be considered when assessing the value of measles control programs.

T1  - Clues to the mystery of multiple sclerosis
A1  - Gorelick P.B. 
Y1  - 1989//
N2  - While the cause of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains obscure, epidemiologic investigation suggests that environmental factors encountered years before onset could be responsible. Studies elucidating age-specific onset curves, worldwide distribution, epidemics, clustering, and risk of contraction after migration are consistent with the belief that MS may be caused by exposure to an infectious agent, possibly viral, at or shortly after puberty. Indirect evidence from serologic studies of serum and CSF shows elevated antibody titers to a number of viruses in MS patients. Although the absence of reproducible direct evidence of virus or viral remnants in brain tissue of patients with MS casts doubt on the viral hypothesis, it cannot be excluded. The theory that MS represents a complicated virus-host interaction with a secondary mechanism that initiates or prevents the process and its exacerbations implies that at least two components are present - one producing the disease and one immunizing against it. Results from studies of geographic distribution, migration, and age at onset make this model plausible. Further understanding of the molecular biology of viruses and results of epidemiologic studies of migration will help settle this argument and may lead to prevention of the disease.

N2  - A model is developed to describe the spread of HIV within heterosexual communities and the demographic impact of AIDS. The model combines epidemiologic and demographic processes and is designed to mirror the impact of AIDS in subSaharan Africa. Refinements on past work in this area include unequal probabilities for transmission from females to males and from males to females, the inclusion of an age- and sex-dependent sexual-partner choice function and distributed incubation plus infectious periods. Numerical studies suggest that unequal transmission probabilities (weighted to a greater probability from males to females than vice versa), and the tendency of males to choose sexual partners of the opposite sex younger than themselves, both act to increase the demographic impact of AIDS over that predicted with equal transmission between the sexes and partner choice restricted within given age classes. Analyses support the conclusions of past work that the epidemic will only have a small detrimental impact on the dependency ratio of a population (the ratio of dependents to working adults) even when a weighting is added to take account of the extra burden imposed by the care of adult AIDS patients. However, a small increase in the ratio can imply a significant rise in the number of dependents within the population. Simulation studies of the impact of changes in behavior to reduce transmission to the need to induce such changes as early as possible in the course of the epidemic in order to minimize its impact. Directions for future research are discussed emphasizing the need to acquire quantitative data on sexual habits and to construct models to represent heterogeneity in sexual behavior.

T1  - Censoring in an epidemic with an application to hemophilia-associated AIDS
A1  - Brookmeyer R.
A1  - Goedert J.J. 
Y1  - 1989//
N2  - In epidemiologic studies in infectious diseases, the times of infection may be known only up to an interval. A two-stage parametric regression model is proposed for the analysis of cohort studies during an epidemic in which the exact time of infection cannot be ascertained. The methods permit joint estimation of the effects of covariates both on the risk of infection and the risk of progression to clinical disease once infected. The methodology is applied to a cohort of hemophiliacs who were at risk of infection with the AIDS virus. It was found that hemophiliacs with severe Type A hemophilia were at highest risk of infection, and the risk of infection increased sharply in the early 1980s. Hemophiliacs who were over the age of 20 at infection were at higher risk of progression to AIDS than hemophiliacs who were under age 20. The estimate of the cumulative probability of developing AIDS within t years of infection (the incubation period distribution) for hemophiliacs over age 20 was 1 - exp(-.0021t2.516). Since follow-up in this cohort was restricted to about 10 years from infection, estimates of the incubation period distribution beyond 10 years depend on model extrapolation and should be interpreted cautiously.

Y1  - 1989//
N2  - A large epidemic of disease caused by Group A sulfonamide-resistant Neisseria meningitidis has been occurring in Auckland, New Zealand, from June, 1985, and peaking in October, 1985 (spring), and June, 1986 (winter). By the end of 1986 an overall attack rate of 8.3 cases/100,000 total population per year had been calculated. The attack rate in children younger than 15 years was 30.4/100,000/year and the highest rate occurred in children younger than 5 years: all Auckland 68.8/100,000/year; South and Central Auckland 98.7/100,000/year. Seventy-nine percent of cases younger than 15 years of age occurred in 30% of the childhood population. The overall case-fatality ratio was 7% with the highest rate (22%) occurring in male children age 1 to 2 years. An outbreak in an industrialized country of an infectious disease usually seen in developing countries calls for investigation of living conditions and other socio-demographic factors in the population affected. Specific action in the form of a vaccination program particularly targeted to those at risk was planned and implemented before the winter of 1987.

N2  - A statistical model is presented for the analysis of infectious disease data from family studies in the community. The model partitions the sources of infection into those from within the household and those from the community at large. The parameters reflecting these sources of infection are estimated as functions of the risk factors. This new model is used to overcome problems associated with the lack of independence of observations in infectious disease data and negative confounding due to the association of unmeasured exposures and immunity. An example of how this new statistical model is used to provide a clearer and less confounded description of risk factor effects is presented for data from influenza A(H3N2) epidemic seasons in the Tecumseh Respiratory Illness Study. The risk factors examined are age and pre-epidemic season antibody level as measured by the hemagglutination-inhibition test, while the outcome is the infection rate. A standard analysis of the data indicates that the efficacy of protective antibodies is 70% in children and only 47% in adults. However, such an efficacy measurement is negatively confounded by past exposure which is age dependent. By means of the model, the true, unconfounded, efficacy of protective antibodies is shown to be 90% in both adults and children.

Y1  - 1988//
N2  - The Longini-Koopman model (1982, Biometrics 38, 115-126) describes the process underlying the transmission of an infectious disease in terms of household and community level transmission probabilities. This model is generalized by allowing for different transmission probabilities that may correspond to various levels of risk factors on both the household and community levels. Two types of models are considered: (i) models for household data, where the numbers of susceptible and infected members in each household are known along with the values of household level risk factors; and (ii) models for individual data, where the infection status and risk factor level are known for each individual in the household. Although the type (i) models can be expressed as special cases of the type (ii) models, they deserve special attention as they can be represented and analyzed as log-linear models. Both types of models can be analyzed using maximum likelihood methods, while the type (i) models, when expressed as log-linear models, can also be analyzed by the weighted least squares method. Data from influenza epidemics in Tecumseh, Michigan and Seattle, Washington are used to illustrate these methods.

T1  - Multiple sclerosis in the Faroe Islands. III. An alternative assessment of the three epidemics
A1  - Kurtzke J.F.
A1  - Hyllested K. 
Y1  - 1987//
N2  - Among 32 resident Faroese, clinical MS began between 1943 and 1973 and comprised 3 epidemics, each one significantly later in time and lower in incidence than the preceding. This is confirmed by the present division of the cases of the epidemics according to the calendar time when the patients attained age 11. The risk of MS for Faroese of Epidemic I, (those who acquired the disease from asymptomatic British troops in the World War II occupation), was 18 per 10,000. Depending on the minimum population number required for transmission, the MS risk for Epidemic II was 15 per 18 per 10,000, and for Epidemic III (under our second model) 9 or 11 per 10,000, none differing significantly from Epidemic I. We conclude that the primary MS affection (PMSA) is a single, widespread, specific, systemic infectious disease whose acquisition in virgin populations follows 2 years of exposure starting between age 11 and 45, which then produces clinical neurologic MS (CNMS) in only a small proportion of the affected after an incubation period of 6 (virgin populace) or 12 (endemic areas) years, and which is transmissible only during part or all of this systemic PMSA phase that ends by age 27 or younger.

T1  - On the role of 'transients' (biasing transitional effects) for the prognostic analysis of the AIDS epidemic
A1  - Gonzalez J.J.
A1  - Koch M.G. 
Y1  - 1987//
N2  - The main point in this paper is that transients occur for diseases having long and highly variable incubation periods. At the beginning of an epidemic, the positive onset transient can have a marked effect. As the transient passes, a decline is observable in the rate of new cases appearing, even in the absence of change in the rate of spread of the infectious agent. Furthermore, the apparency of the epidemic, the observed distribution of incubation periods, and the age distribution of manifest cases change while the transient passes. The recent observation that the seroconversion latency period can last for more than one year implies that transient effects are also of importance here. Understanding the contribution of the onset transient is highly desirable in order to assess the true rate of growth of the infectious agent and to obtain accurate estimates of the genuine incubation period and seroconversion latency period distribution. In the case of the AIDS epidemic, a simple exponential model for the spread of HIV yields amazingly good agreement with the observed numbers of patients in high-risk groups during an initial stage of several years of duration. The prognostic value of the exponential model for high-risk compartments is restricted because the depletion of the population of susceptibles alone suggests that the exponential phase of the growth curve of HIV carriers has passed, or will pass in the near future, for all countries considered. For other compartments, where the dominant infection modus may be less effective and the typical infection doses may be considerably less than for transmission through male homosexual intercourse or transfusion of infected blood, consideration should be given to the possibility that incubation periods for AIDS may be noticeably longer. If this is so, it may be expected that the more recent AIDS epidemic for promiscuous heterosexuals, say, could be described by a simple exponential model for some years to come. Negative transients appear when the rate of spread of the virus declines. The role of negative transients in the future course of the AIDS epidemic deserves further study.

A1  - Morens D.M.

Y1  - 1986//
N2  - The largest and most extensive documented dengue epidemic in Puerto Rico struck an estimated 355,000 Puerto Rican residents from July-December 1977. The mixed epidemic of dengue types 2 and 3 coincided with a Caribbean pandemic of dengue type 1, first introduced into the western hemisphere in early 1977 and in Puerto Rico in the fall of that year. Health officials assembled a team to assess the epidemic and mounted a campaign to end it. Attempts to monitor the incidence and spread of dengue were confounded by simultaneous co-circulation of influenza virus, underscoring problems in formulating public health strategies dependent on non-specific clinical and epidimiologic case criteria, and the need for rapid and reliable diagnostic capabilities. Despite co-circulation of multiple dengue serotypes, a risk factor associated with severe and fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in Southeast Asia, hospital and death certificate surveillance disclosed no cases of DHF in Puerto Rico. The epidemic serves as a reminder that when preventive measures are impossible or infeasable, developed countries with high living standards may be susceptible to large scale epidemics of infectious diseases.

Y1  - 1985//
N2  - It is estimated that approximately 70 to 80% of the world's HBsAg carriers live in Southeast Asia, but studies of delta infection in this area are still limited. We studied 323 HBsAg seropositive patients in Japan, and 4 (1.2%) of them were found to be positive for anti-delta antibody, with none positive for delta antigen. These four patients did not belong to the known high-risk groups for delta infection. One HBeAg positive female gave birth to a baby girl, and perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus and delta was successfully blocked by a combination of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and vaccine. This study in the Tokyo-Chiba area showed delta infection, though low in frequency, among ordinary Japanese citizens. It has been reported that delta antigen is highly infectious to HBsAg carriers and that its infection will cause severe liver damage. Once introduced, it could become epidemic among non-drug users in a country where hepatitis B virus infection is endemic. At this moment, the only way of preventing such a disaster appears to be to reduce the number of chronic carriers by interruption of vertical transmission.

T1  - An epidemic chain model
A1  - Becker N. 
Y1  - 1980//
N2  - An epidemic chain model is developed by assuming a beta distribution for the probability of being infected by contact with a given infective from the same household. This model includes, as a particular case, the epidemic chain model corresponding to the stochastic Kermack-McKendrick model and, as a limiting case, the Reed-Frost chain binomial model. The advantages of the more general model are illustrated with an application to household data for the common cold. Finally, it is shown how the coefficient of variation of the duration of the infectious period may be estimated without any direct observations on this duration.

T1  - Dynamics of acute bacterial diseases. Part II. Epidemiological models of acute bacterial diseases
A1  - Cvjetanovic B.
A1  - Uemura K.
A1  - Grab B. 
Y1  - 1978//
N2  - Tetanus is one of the rare, endemic, infectious diseases that is not communicable in the strict sense, since it is not transmitted from man to man. The absence of interhuman transmission, which is typical of tetanus, simplifies the model since the risk of being infected can be considered in principle as constant. It depends on the ecological patterns of the community and man's physical surroundings - the soil, agriculture and husbandry - as reflected in the force of infection, and not on the presence or absence of infection in the population. Tetanus is actually more an environmental hazard than a communicable disease. The natural history of the disease is rather simple, except for the existence of two distinct epidemiological entities: tetanus neonatorum in the newborn and tetanus in all other age groups. Typhoid fever, which is another endemic disease, also occurs in outbreaks. There is interhuman transmission and a carrier state in this infection. We have studied the endemic situation, which is a particularly grave problem in developing countries, and the effect of two different control measures - sanitation and immunization; we have also made cost-effectiveness analyses of various long-term control strategies. This was the first model that we developed and applied, because the natural history of typhoid fever is relatively simple and straightforward, and the model has proved to have many useful applications. Cholera which, even in endemic areas, appears in the form of seasonal epidemic outbreaks, required a different approach from typhoid, and we had to simulate both endemic situations with seasonal variations and epidemics, using deterministic and stochastic approaches. Endemic and epidemic patterns of cholera were studied and simulations made of the effects of vaccination, sanitation, and chemoprophylaxis. Since the effectiveness of these measures has been evaluated in controlled field trials, realistic simulations were possible. Some of these provided a basis for re-evaluation of common practices used in the control of cholera. Cerebrospinal meningitis represents a disease with typical and extreme seasonal variations, particularly in endemic areas of Africa, and it required a special modelling technique. The lack of precise information on the natural history of this disease and different epidemiological features of infections due to various serogroups of Neisseria meningitidis made the construction of the model difficult and also complicated its uses. Diphtheria and whooping cough, which are typical diseases of early childhood, required the introduction of age structure in the model. Only one of them has a carrier state but otherwise, in terms of model construction and uses, they behave very much alike and are therefore presented together. Other acute bacterial diseases, such as enteric infections and respiratory diseases - namely droplet-borne infections of childhood - as well as cross infections in hospital and sexually transmitted diseases require still other approaches in the construction of their models, but essentially the principles that we applied in modelling the bacterial diseases referred to above, would apply to these and other acute bacterial diseases for which models have yet to be made.

T1  - Overview and horizons in prevention of some human infectious diseases by vaccination
A1  - Sabin A.B. 
Y1  - 1978//
N2  - The present measles problem in the United States, an estimated 918,500 cases in 1977, is attributed to the failure of the 14-year vaccination program to immunize enough children to prevent continued circulation of the virus and recurrent outbreaks. A new strategy for rapidly overcoming this problem is recommended. There appears to be no current congenital rubella syndrome problem against which the rubella vaccination program in the United States is directed. However, the continued annual infection of an estimated two million children conceivably could again bring forth a rubella virus with a greater capacity for producing congenital rubella syndrome, and a modification of the present program is recommended. About 80 to 90% of the annual 60-70 million cases of influenza severe enough to confine the victim to bed are not caused by the influenza viruses. Except for the few thousand additional deaths directly attributed to influenza A virus during the epidemic years, mortality rates for pneumonia, heart disease, chronic bronchopulmonary diseases, and other former 'high risk' conditions have continued to decrease in recent years, and have not risen during the 12-month periods of epidemic years. A re-evaluation of the current influenza vaccination policy is recommended. Prospects for hepatitis B and varicella-zoster vaccines are discussed.

Y1  - 1976//
N2  - The report is considered appropriate in view of the not infrequent uncertainty by both internists and gynaecologists in respect to the diagnosis of icterus in pregnancy. Physiological changes in the mother are mentioned with a view to avoiding incorrect assessment of biochemical laboratory results. Particular attention is paid to differentiating types of icterus which are specific to pregnancy from those which arise from other causes. The evaluation of mortality and morbidity of the mother and child appears to be particularly important in discussing various clinical pictures. By reason of the difficulty in differentiating infectious hepatitis from other diseases which present with jaundice, it seems justifiable to the authors to isolate every pregnant patient with icterus until such time as the disease is proved not to be infectious. In many cases it is difficult to differentiate cholostasis, which occurs relatively frequently in pregnancy, from early epidemic hepatitis. In view of this the necessity arises for every patient having icterus in pregnancy to be investigated and treated jointly by the obstetrician and internist. Since icterus of any kind in pregnancy is to be regarded as a risk also for the child, prenatal supervision of the child should be particularly intensive. The colorimetric estimation of total estrogen excretion in 24 hour urine can be confused by bile pigments. This is not the case when radioimmunologic methods for the determination of estrogen in urine and serum estriol are used, so that, when pregnancy is complicated by icterus, only the use of these methods gives reliable information about the prenatal condition of the child.

T1  - A deterministic model of vector borne epidemics using partial differential equations
A1  - Adler G. 
Y1  - 1976//
N2  - A deterministic model of vector borne epidemics affecting a human and a vector population is presented in terms of partial differential equations. In the human and vector population we distinguish the following groups: humans: non infected (N(h)), latent (in incubation period) (L(h)), infectious (I(h)), recovered (R(h)), dead (D(h)); vectors: non infected (N(m)), infectious (L(m)), dead (D(m)). The independent variables for describing the process in the two populations are the following: humans: time, time spent in the latent group, time spent in the infectious group; vectors: time, age. Probabilities of transition between the different groups are incorporated in the model as weight functions. The equations governing the process are given. An interesting feature of the model is that the solutions show very stable oscillation frequencies which depend on the transition probabilities but do not depend on the oscillation of the birth rate of the vectors.

A1  - Corrie R.N.

Y1  - 1974//
N2  - A continuing surveillance of two hospitals in the Oklahoma City area was undertaken to determine the incidence of hospital acquired infections, by geographic location, sites infected, types of infectious agents, possible predisposing factors and demographic data. This report covers a four month period. An overall rate of persons acquiring a hospital infection was 3.96 per 100 admissions. The risk of multiple hospital acquired infections for the same four month period was 5.49 per 100 admissions. Rates based on discharges and patient days were also calculated, and the denominator of choice used to represent the risk population was discussed. Surgical and children's areas accounted for the highest incidence of patients with nosocomial infections (4.9 and 3.8 infected patients per 100 admissions). Similarly, the highest rates of multiple infections (7.4 vs 5.6 infections per 100 admissions) were also observed within these two services. The urinary tract and surgical wounds were the sites in which over one half of all hospital acquired infections were isolated. E. coli, Klebsiella sp., and Pseudomonas sp. constituted 45% of all microbial isolations. The normally non pathogenic Serratia marcescens comprised 5% of the total isolations from hospital acquired infections. Although 'causal' relationships cannot be established, intravenous catheters or cutdowns and indwelling urinary catheters were present more frequently just prior to onset of infection than any other type of instrument examined. Among non instruments, systemic antimicrobial agents were administered for various reasons in 82% of the hospital acquired infections. Case control studies would have to be done before valid associations could be made. No important disparities were observed for either age or sex. Data such as these are important to collect for all hospitals to determine baseline or endemic levels of infections. Epidemic situations would therefore be evident when the level of new infections rises above and beyond the endemic level. Also, the monitoring of types of microbial agents isolated from infections would help to identify changes in hospital bacterial flora.
